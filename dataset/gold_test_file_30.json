The show premiered on August 6 , 2013 , on Game Show Network ( GSN ) . It is hosted by Brooke Burns , and features Mark Labbett ( nicknamed `` The Beast '' ) as the `` chaser '' . </P> <P> The American version of the show follows the same general format as the original UK version , but with teams of three contestants instead of four . The game is a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win money by challenging a quiz show genius known as the chaser . Each contestant participates in an individual `` chase '' called the Cash Builder , in which they attempt to answer as many questions as possible in 60 seconds to earn as much money as possible to contribute to a prize fund for the team . The contestant must answer enough questions to stay ahead of the chaser on the gameboard ; otherwise they lose their winnings for that round . The contestants who successfully complete their individual chases without being caught advance to the Final Chase , in which they answer questions as a team playing for an equal share of the prize fund accumulated throughout the episode . </P> <P> The Chase received positive critical reception ; Burns and Labbett earned positive reviews for their roles , and one critic praised the series for avoiding a slow pace in gameplay . Both the series and Burns received Daytime Emmy Award nominations ; the series was nominated in 2014 for Outstanding Game Show , and Burns two years later for Outstanding Game Show Host . Each lost to Jeopardy ! and Craig Ferguson ( host of Celebrity Name Game ) respectively . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Gameplay <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Cash Builder and individual chases </Li> <Li> 1.2 The Final Chase </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Production </Li> <Li> 3 Reception <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 3.2 Ratings </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Gameplay ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Cash Builder and individual chases ( edit ) </H3> Screenshot illustrating how an individual chase appears on - screen ; a contestant has selected the higher $90,000 offer and is thus six correct answers away from banking the money , while the chaser , represented by the red arrow , is two spaces behind . <P> Three new contestants compete on each episode as a team . In the first round , each contestant in turn wins money for their team by answering as many questions correctly as possible during a one - minute rapid - fire round , entitled the `` Cash Builder '' . Each correct answer in this round adds $5,000 to the bank ; during celebrity episodes , contestants start with $5,000 already in the bank . At the end of the Cash Builder , the contestant participates in a key element of the show called a `` chase '' . In the chase , the chaser and the contestant each answer questions ; the contestant starts with an advantage , and the chaser attempts to catch up . The contestant 's goal is to answer enough questions correctly to move the earned winnings along the gameboard into the team bank without being caught by the chaser , whose job is to catch them by capitalizing on their mistakes . </P> <P> The chaser starts eight spaces away from the bank . The contestant has the option of starting five steps away from the bank , meaning that they must answer five questions correctly without being caught to bank the money and continue to the next round . Before the chase starts , the chaser will make two offers to the contestant : one offer will be to play for a lower amount , but start one step closer to the bank , meaning that they will have to answer one less question correctly ; the other offer will be to play for a higher amount , but start one step further away from the bank . On rare occasions , if the contestant chooses the higher offer , the chaser may escalate the stakes by offering a `` super offer '' for an even higher amount . In this case , the contestant must answer seven questions correctly without being caught , meaning that the contestant needs to answer every question in that round ( if the chaser does so ) . </P> <P> After the contestant decides for which amount to play , the prize money is displayed on the gameboard . The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question , and each locks in their answer , which can not then be changed ; the other has five seconds to answer after them , otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard . For each question the contestant answers correctly , the prize money shown on the gameboard moves one step closer to the team bank . Similarly , the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant 's prize money with each correct answer . Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board ( thus banking the prize money ) , or the chaser catches the contestant , eliminating them from the game . No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit . </P> <P> After all three contestants have played a Cash Builder round followed by a chase , the contestants who were not caught by the chaser advance to the Final Chase , with the team bank set to the total that they won in their Cash Builder rounds . If all three contestants fail to win their individual chases , the team selects one contestant to play the Final Chase alone for a total of $15,000 ( $5,000 per contestant ) . During celebrity episodes , contestants who are caught leave with $5,000 for their respective charities . </P> <H3> The Final Chase ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Final Chase is played on a gameboard . The team receives a head start of one space for each member who advanced to this round . During the commercial break , the team chooses between two sets of questions , labeled `` A '' and `` B '' . The chaser plays the other set . The contestants have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible . After a question is asked , answers must be instantaneous , and contestants are only permitted to respond or pass a question after first ringing in . If a contestant rings in but another contestant answers , the answer is treated as wrong even if it was correct . If there is only one contestant in the Final Chase , then he or she does not ring in . Each question answered correctly within the time limit moves the team one space ahead on the board . </P> <P> After time expires , the chaser is given two minutes to catch the team by correctly answering a new series of questions , with each correct answer moving him one space along the board . If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes , the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question , which they may confirm among themselves before answering . A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space , or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard . An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all . Regardless of the outcome , the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions . If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team , the team splits the banked money equally , but if he catches them before time expires , the team leaves with no money . During celebrity episodes , if the chaser catches the team before time runs out , the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> Brooke Burns , host of The Chase <P> The Chase originated in the United Kingdom , premiering on ITV in 2009 . As the series became increasingly popular in the UK , Fox ordered two pilot episodes in April 2012 to be taped in London for consideration to be added to the network 's U.S. programming lineup . Bradley Walsh , presenter of the British version , was featured as the show 's host , while UK chaser Mark Labbett ( nicknamed `` The Beast '' , which is `` la b\u00eate '' in French ) and Jeopardy ! champion Brad Rutter were the chasers . </P> <P> After Fox passed up the opportunity to add the series to its lineup , Game Show Network ( GSN ) , in conjunction with ITV Studios America , picked up the series with an eight - episode order on April 9 , 2013 , and announced Brooke Burns as the show 's host and Labbett as the chaser on May 29 . Dan Patrick had originally been considered as the host . The first season premiered on August 6 , 2013 . Even though the show had not yet premiered at the time , the network ordered a second season of eight episodes on July 1 , 2013 , which premiered on November 5 . Citing the series ' status as a `` ratings phenom '' , GSN eventually announced plans to renew it for a third season , which premiered in the summer of 2014 . During the third season , the series also premiered its first celebrity edition with celebrity contestants playing for charity . GSN proceeded to renew the series for a fourth season before the end of season three ; this new season began airing January 27 , 2015 . After the seventh episode of the season , the series went on another hiatus ; new episodes from the fourth season resumed airing July 16 , 2015 . No new episodes have aired since the season four finale , which aired December 11 , 2015 . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Chase was generally well received by critics . Michael Tyminski of Manhattan Digest reviewed the series positively , calling it `` a breath of fresh air '' and praising Burns and Labbett in their respective roles . Tyminski added that while each question 's level of difficulty is not always on par with those on other quiz shows such as Jeopardy ! , the show avoids a `` painfully slow pace '' . Similarly , John Teti of The A.V. Club called the show a `` pretty good adaptation '' of its UK counterpart . While he preferred the British version of the show , saying that it had `` a more varied cast and stronger production values '' , Teti felt that the American version `` still holds its own . '' The Chase was also ranked ninth on Douglas Pucci 's ( of TV Media Insights ) list of best new television shows of 2013 . </P> <P> The Chase was one of two GSN originals ( the other being The American Bible Challenge ) to be honored at the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards in 2014 with an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Game Show ; Jeopardy ! was the eventual winner . Two years later , Burns received an Emmy nomination at the 43rd Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game Show Host , losing to Craig Ferguson of Celebrity Name Game . </P> <H3> Ratings ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Chase became one of the highest rated original programs in GSN 's history . The series debuted to 511,000 total viewers during its premiere while maintaining 90 % of its audience with 461,000 total viewers during the second episode airing that night . On January 28 , 2014 , The Chase set a new series high for total viewers and adults 18 -- 49 , with 827,000 and 234,000 viewers respectively . Although the season three premiere fell in the ratings from its series high , earning 494,000 viewers with only 73,000 in the 18 -- 49 demographic , the premiere of the fourth season saw a sizeable rise over the previous season 's premiere , earning 749,000 total viewers . </P> <H2> Merchandise ( edit ) </H2> <P> On December 18 , 2013 , Barnstorm Games released a mobile version of the game for iOS and Android . The only differences between the app and the show are that four choices are presented for questions in the Cash Builder and the Final Chase rounds and that no Final Chase is played if all players are caught in their individual chases . The app features Labbett ( referred to by his `` Beast '' nickname ) as a simulated chaser and can be played by up to four people . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kondology , Amanda ( June 18 , 2013 ) . `` GSN Announces Premiere of ' The Chase ' on Tuesday , August 6 at 9PM '' .

As this traditional winter sport could be conducted indoors , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) approved its inclusion in the Summer Olympics program . It was featured a second time at the Antwerp Games , after which it was permanently transferred to the program of the Winter Olympic Games , first held in 1924 in Chamonix , France . </P> <P> In London , figure skating was presented in four events : men 's singles , women 's singles , men 's special figures , and mixed pairs . The special figures contest was won by Russian Nikolai Panin , who gave his country its first ever Olympic gold medal . He remains the event 's sole winner , as it was subsequently dropped from the program . </P> <P> Ice dance joined as a medal sport in 1976 , after appearing as a demonstration event at Grenoble 1968 . </P> <P> A team event debuted at the 2014 Olympics . It consists of two segments : qualification and finals . During qualification each team has one men 's single skater , one ladies ' single skater , one pair , and one ice dance couple skate their short program / dance . Before the finals , each team is allowed to replace up to two skaters / couples . The final consists of each skater / couple skating their short program / dance . Results are determined by placement points . </P> <H2> Qualifying ( edit ) </H2> <P> The number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games is limited by a quota set by the International Olympic Committee . There are 30 participants in each singles events ( ladies and men ) , 20 pairs , and 24 ice dance duos . </P> <P> Skaters must represent a member nation of the International Skating Union and reach the age of fifteen before July 1 of the previous year . They are also required to be citizens of the country they are representing . Competitors have until just before the Olympics to receive citizenship . Since nationality rules are less strict for the ISU Championships , sometimes skaters who have competed at World or European championships are not eligible for the Olympics . </P> <P> 80 % of the Olympic spots ( 24 men / ladies , 19 dance couples , 16 pairs ) are allotted to countries according to the results of the previous year 's World Figure Skating Championships . A country may have a maximum of three entries per discipline . Countries earn two or three entries by earning points through their skaters ' placements . The points are equal to the sum of the placements of the country 's skaters ( top two if they have three ) . If a country only has one skater / couple , that skater / couple must place in the top ten to earn two entries and in the top two to earn three entries . If a country has two skaters / teams , the combined placement of those teams must be 13 or less to qualify 3 entries , and 28 or less to qualify two entries . The remaining places are awarded to one skater / couple each from countries that failed to get multiple places , in order of their skaters ' placement in the world championships . </P> <P> Following the World Championships , countries that have not qualified an entry in a particular discipline receive another opportunity in an international competition held in the autumn ( usually the Nebelhorn Trophy ) prior to the Olympic Games . Six spots are available in men 's singles , six in ladies ' singles , four in pairs , and five in ice dance . At some Olympics , the host country is automatically entitled to one entry in each discipline , e.g. in 1994 , 2010 , and 2018 if minimum scores are achieved . If a country receives a spot by being the host , one fewer spot is available in the autumn qualifying competition . </P> <P> The selection of representatives is at the national governing body 's discretion . Some countries rely on the results of their national championships while others have more varied criteria . This may include reaching a certain placement at the European Figure Skating Championships and the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships . </P> <H2> Events ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th>

With deliberately both vague and vivid descriptions , the narrator depicts a summer festival in the utopian city of Omelas , whose prosperity depends on the perpetual misery of a single child . </P> <P> `` The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas '' was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Short Fiction in 1974 and won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1974 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Publication </Li> <Li> 2 Synopsis </Li> <Li> 3 Background and themes </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Sources </Li> </Ul> <H2> Publication ( edit ) </H2> <P> Le Guin 's piece was originally published in New Dimensions 3 , a hard - cover science fiction anthology edited by Robert Silverberg , in October 1973 . It was reprinted in Le Guin 's The Wind 's Twelve Quarters in 1975 , and has been frequently anthologized elsewhere . </P> <P> It has also appeared as an independently published , 31 - page hardcover book for young adults in 1993 . </P> <P> It was republished in the second volume of the short - story anthology The Unreal and the Real in 2014 . </P> <H2> Synopsis ( edit ) </H2> <P> The only chronological element of the work is that it begins by describing the first day of summer in Omelas , a shimmering city of unbelievable happiness and delight . In Omelas , the summer solstice is celebrated with a glorious festival and a race featuring young people on horseback . The vibrant festival atmosphere , however , seems to be an everyday characteristic of the blissful community , whose citizens , though limited in their advanced technology to communal ( rather than private ) resources , are still intelligent , sophisticated , and cultured . Omelas has no kings , soldiers , priests , or slaves . The specific socio - politico - economic setup of the community is not mentioned , but the narrator merely explains that the reader can not be sure of every particular . </P> <P> Self - admittedly , the uncertain narrator reflects that `` Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale , long ago and far away , once upon a time . Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids , assuming it will rise to the occasion , for certainly I can not suit you all . '' The narrator even suggests that , if necessary , the reader may include an orgy in their mental picture of Omelas . </P> <P> Everything about Omelas is so abundantly pleasing that the narrator decides the reader is not yet truly convinced of its existence and so elaborates upon one final element of the city : its one atrocity . The city 's constant state of serenity and splendor requires that a single unfortunate child be kept in perpetual filth , darkness , and misery . </P> <P> Once citizens are old enough to know the truth , most , though initially shocked and disgusted , ultimately acquiesce with that one injustice which secures the happiness of the rest of the city . However , a few citizens , young and old , silently walk away from the city , and no one knows where they go . The writing ends with `` The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness . I can not describe it at all . It is possible it does not exist . But they seem to know where they are going , the ones who walk away from Omelas . '' </P> <H2> Background and themes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Le Guin stated that the city 's name is pronounced `` OH - meh - lahss '' . Le Guin hit upon the name of the town on seeing a road sign for Salem , Oregon , in a car mirror . `` ( ... People ask me ) ' Where do you get your ideas from , Ms. Le Guin ? ' From forgetting Dostoyevsky and reading road signs backwards , naturally . Where else ? '' </P> <P> `` The central idea of this psychomyth , the scapegoat '' , writes Le Guin , `` turns up in Dostoyevsky 's Brothers Karamazov , and several people have asked me , rather suspiciously , why I gave the credit to William James . The fact is , I have n't been able to re-read Dostoyevsky , much as I loved him , since I was twenty - five , and I 'd simply forgotten he used the idea . But when I met it in James ' ' The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life , ' it was with a shock of recognition . '' </P> <P> The quote from William James is : </P> <P> Or if the hypothesis were offered us of a world in which Messrs. Fourier 's and Bellamy 's and Morris 's utopias should all be outdone , and millions kept permanently happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far - off edge of things should lead a life of lonely torture , what except a sceptical and independent sort of emotion can it be which would make us immediately feel , even though an impulse arose within us to clutch at the happiness so offered , how hideous a thing would be its enjoyment when deliberately accepted as the fruit of such a bargain ? </P> <P> Introducing the short work in her 2012 collection The Unreal and the Real , Volume Two , Le Guin noted that The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas `` has a long and happy career of being used by teachers to upset students and make them argue fiercely about morality . '' </P> <P> It has been at times analyzed as a postmodernist work . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Spivack , Charlotte , Ursula K.

The voice actors , in portraying the various character personalities on the show , draw inspiration from celebrities and pop culture . Family Guy characters have been played by more than one actor , after members of the show left the series or had conflicting obligations . </P> <P> Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award for voicing Meg Griffin in the season 5 episode `` Barely Legal '' and MacFarlane has also won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice - Over Performance and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production , though no other cast member has won an award for their work on the series . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Current cast <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Seth MacFarlane </Li> <Li> 1.2 Alex Borstein </Li> <Li> 1.3 Mila Kunis </Li> <Li> 1.4 Seth Green </Li> <Li> 1.5 Mike Henry </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Recurring cast </Li> <Li> 3 Recurring guest voices </Li> <Li> 4 Casting changes </Li> <Li> 5 Awards and nominations </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Current cast ( edit ) </H2> Seth Green provides the voice of Chris Griffin . Mike Henry voices various characters in the series . Mila Kunis provides the voice of Meg Griffin . Alex Borstein provides the voice of Lois Griffin . Patrick Warburton provides the voice of Joe Swanson . The real Adam West provided the voice of Mayor Adam West . <P> From seasons 1 to 4 , Family Guy had four main cast members . Since season 5 , there have been five main cast members . The casting of Meg Griffin changed after season 1 . </P> <H3> Seth MacFarlane ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seth MacFarlane voices three of the show 's main characters : Peter Griffin , Brian Griffin , and Stewie Griffin . MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself , believing it would be easier to portray the voices he had already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it . MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design . Stewie 's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison , especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady . MacFarlane uses his own voice while portraying Brian . </P> <P> MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one - time only characters , most prominently those of neighbour Glenn Quagmire , news anchor Tom Tucker , Lois ' father Carter Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman . He explained on the Graham Norton Show that the voice for Glenn Quagmire is based on 1940s and 1950s radio commercials . He is the only voice to be in every episode . </P> <H3> Alex Borstein ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alex Borstein voices Lois Griffin , Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa , Loretta Brown and Lois ' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt . Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv . She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was `` really sight unseen '' . At the time , Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles , in which she played a redhead mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins . The voice was originally slower ( and deeper for the original series ) , but when MacFarlane heard it , he replied `` Make it a little less fucking annoying ... and speed it up , or every episode will last four hours . '' </P> <H3> Mila Kunis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mila Kunis voices Meg Griffin . Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character , in part due to her performance on That ' 70s Show . MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition , instructing her to speak slower , and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more . Once she claimed that she had it under control , MacFarlane hired her . Kunis described her character as `` the scapegoat '' . She further explained , `` Meg gets picked on a lot . But it 's funny . It 's like the middle child . She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14 - year - old , when you 're kind of going through puberty and what - not . She 's just in a perpetual mode of humiliation . And it 's fun . '' </P> <H3> Seth Green ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seth Green primarily plays Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman . Green stated that he did an impression of the `` Buffalo Bill '' character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition . His main inspiration for Chris ' voice came from envisioning how `` Buffalo Bill '' would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald 's . </P> <H3> Mike Henry ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mike Henry is the voice of Cleveland Brown , John Herbert The Pervert and various other characters . A Family Guy writer and producer , he began acting on the show as part of the recurring cast repertory ( see below ) but was promoted to main cast member in 2005 . Since the cancellation of The Cleveland Show , he also voices Cleveland 's step - son Rallo Tubbs on Family Guy . </P> <H2> Recurring cast ( edit ) </H2> <P> In addition to both its main cast and guest stars , Family Guy utilizes a deep bench of regularly appearing supporting voice actors . Some appear in nearly every episode each season , while others appear less frequently . Some of these actors specifically play recurring characters , while others mainly play background citizens of Quahog or characters in cutaway gags . </P> <P> The current supporting cast repertory includes the following actors : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Actor </Th> <Th> Character ( s ) </Th> <Th> No. of Episodes ( Out of 245 produced ) </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Benjamin , H.

Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space , originally a marketplace , as the Forum Magnum , or simply the Forum . </P> <P> For centuries the Forum was the center of day - to - day life in Rome : the site of triumphal processions and elections ; the venue for public speeches , criminal trials , and gladiatorial matches ; and the nucleus of commercial affairs . Here statues and monuments commemorated the city 's great men . The teeming heart of ancient Rome , it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world , and in all history . Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills , the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly . </P> <P> Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum . The Roman Kingdom 's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge . These included the ancient former royal residence , the Regia ( 8th century BC ) , and the Temple of Vesta ( 7th century BC ) , as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins , all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome . </P> <P> Other archaic shrines to the northwest , such as the Umbilicus Urbis and the Vulcanal ( Shrine of Vulcan ) , developed into the Republic 's formal Comitium ( assembly area ) . This is where the Senate -- as well as Republican government itself -- began . The Senate House , government offices , tribunals , temples , memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area . </P> <P> Over time the archaic Comitium was replaced by the larger adjacent Forum and the focus of judicial activity moved to the new Basilica Aemilia ( 179 BC ) . Some 130 years later , Julius Caesar built the Basilica Julia , along with the new Curia Julia , refocusing both the judicial offices and the Senate itself . This new Forum , in what proved to be its final form , then served as a revitalized city square where the people of Rome could gather for commercial , political , judicial and religious pursuits in ever greater numbers . </P> <P> Eventually much economic and judicial business would transfer away from the Forum Romanum to the larger and more extravagant structures ( Trajan 's Forum and the Basilica Ulpia ) to the north . The reign of Constantine the Great saw the construction of the last major expansion of the Forum complex -- the Basilica of Maxentius ( 312 AD ) . This returned the political center to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Description </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Roman Kingdom </Li> <Li> 2.2 Roman Republic </Li> <Li> 2.3 Roman Empire </Li> <Li> 2.4 Medieval </Li> <Li> 2.5 Excavation and preservation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Monuments <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Temple of Saturn </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Other fora in Rome </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Description ( edit ) </H2> <P> Unlike the later imperial fora in Rome -- which were self - consciously modelled on the ancient Greek plateia ( \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 ) public plaza or town square -- the Roman Forum developed gradually , organically , and piecemeal over many centuries . This is the case despite attempts , with some success , to impose some order there , by Sulla , Julius Caesar , Augustus and others . By the Imperial period , the large public buildings that crowded around the central square had reduced the open area to a rectangle of about 130 by 50 metres . </P> <P> Its long dimension was oriented northwest to southeast and extended from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to that of the Velian Hill . The Forum 's basilicas during the Imperial period -- the Basilica Aemilia on the north and the Basilica Julia on the south -- defined its long sides and its final form . The Forum proper included this square , the buildings facing it and , sometimes , an additional area ( the Forum Adjectum ) extending southeast as far as the Arch of Titus . </P> <P> Originally , the site of the Forum had been a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained . This was drained by the Tarquins with the Cloaca Maxima . Because of its location , sediments from both the flooding of the Tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the Forum floor for centuries . Excavated sequences of remains of paving show that sediment eroded from the surrounding hills was already raising the level in early Republican times . </P> <P> As the ground around buildings rose , residents simply paved over the debris that was too much to remove . Its final travertine paving , still visible , dates from the reign of Augustus . Excavations in the 19th century revealed one layer on top of another . The deepest level excavated was 3.60 metres above sea level . Archaeological finds show human activity at that level with the discovery of carbonised wood . </P> <P> An important function of the Forum , during both Republican and Imperial times , was to serve as the culminating venue for the celebratory military processions known as Triumphs . Victorious generals entered the city by the western Triumphal Gate ( Porta Triumphalis ) and circumnavigated the Palatine Hill ( counterclockwise ) before proceeding from the Velian Hill down the Via Sacra and into the Forum . </P> <P> From here they would mount the Capitoline Rise ( Clivus Capitolinus ) up to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the summit of the Capitol . Lavish public banquets ensued back down on the Forum . ( In addition to the Via Sacra , the Forum was accessed by a number of storied roads and streets , including the Vicus Jugarius , Vicus Tuscus , Argiletum , and Via Nova . ) </P> The Forum Romanum . View facing north east from above the Portico Dii Consentes . <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Roman Kingdom ( edit ) </H3> A speculative map of Rome c. 753 BC showing the swampy situation of the early Forum between the Arx and Velia . <P> The original , low - lying , grassy wetland of the Forum was drained in the 7th century BC with the building of the Cloaca Maxima , a large covered sewer system that emptied into the Tiber , as more people began to settle between the two hills . </P> <P> According to tradition , the Forum 's beginnings are connected with the alliance between Romulus , the first king of Rome controlling the Palatine Hill , and his rival , Titus Tatius , who occupied the Capitoline Hill . An alliance formed after combat had been halted by the prayers and cries of the Sabine women . Because the valley lay between the two settlements , it was the designated place for the two peoples to meet . Since the early Forum area included pools of stagnant water , the most easily accessible area was the northern part of the valley which was designated as the Comitium . It was here at the Vulcanal that , according to the story , the two parties laid down their weapons and formed an alliance . </P> <P> The Forum was outside the walls of the original Sabine fortress , which was entered through the Porta Saturni . These walls were mostly destroyed when the two hills were joined . The original Forum functioned as an open - air market abutting on the Comitium , but eventually outgrew its day - to - day shopping and marketplace role . As political speeches , civil trials , and other public affairs began to take up more and more space in the Forum , additional fora throughout the city began to emerge to expand on specific needs of the growing population . Fora for cattle , pork , vegetables and wine specialised in their niche products and the associated deities around them . </P> <P> Rome 's second king , Numa Pompilius ( r . 715 -- 673 BC ) , is said to have begun the cult of Vesta , building its house and temple as well as the Regia as the city 's first royal palace . Later Tullus Hostilius ( r . 673 -- 642 BC ) enclosed the Comitium around the old Etruscan temple where the senate would meet at the site of the Sabine conflict . He is said to have converted that temple into the Curia Hostilia close to where the Senate originally met in an old Etruscan hut . In 600 BC Tarquinius Priscus had the area paved for the first time . </P> <H3> Roman Republic ( edit ) </H3> Map of the Roman Forum . Structures of Republican Rome are shown in red , those of Imperial Rome in black . From Platner 's Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome , 1904 . ( Adjusted ) <P> During the Republican period the Comitium continued to be the central location for all judicial and political life in the city . However , in order to create a larger gathering place , the Senate began expanding the open area between the Comitium and the Temple of Vesta by purchasing existing private homes and removing them for public use . Building projects of several consuls repaved and built onto both the Comitium and the adjacent central plaza that was becoming the Forum . </P> <P> The 5th century BC witnessed the earliest Forum temples with known dates of construction : the Temple of Saturn ( 497 BC ) and the Temple of Castor and Pollux ( 484 BC ) . The Temple of Concord was added in the following century , possibly by the soldier and statesman Marcus Furius Camillus . A long - held tradition of speaking from the elevated speakers ' Rostra -- originally facing north towards the Senate House to the assembled politicians and elites -- put the orator 's back to the people assembled in the Forum . A tribune known as Caius Licinius ( consul in 361 BC ) is said to have been the first to turn away from the elite towards the Forum , an act symbolically repeated two centuries later by Gaius Gracchus . </P> <P> This began the tradition of locus popularis , in which even young nobles were expected to speak to the people from the Rostra . Gracchus was thus credited with ( or accused of ) disturbing the mos maiorum ( `` custom of the fathers / ancestors '' ) in ancient Rome . When Censor in 318 BC , Gaius Maenius provided buildings in the Forum neighborhood with balconies , which were called after him maeniana , in order that the spectators might better view the games put on within the temporary wooden arenas set up there . </P> <P> The Tribune benches were placed on the Forum Romanum , as well . First , they stood next to the senate house ; during the late Roman Republic they were placed in front of the Basilica Porcia . </P> <P> The earliest basilicas ( large , aisled halls ) were introduced to the Forum in 184 BC by Marcus Porcius Cato , which began the process of `` monumentalizing '' the site . The Basilica Fulvia was dedicated on the north side of the Forum square in 179 BC . ( It was rebuilt and renamed several times , as Basilica Fulvia et Aemilia , Basilica Paulli , Basilica Aemilia ) . Nine years later , the Basilica Sempronia was dedicated on the south side . </P> <P> Many of the traditions from the Comitium , such as the popular assemblies , funerals nobles and games , were transferred to the Forum as it developed . Especially notable was the move of the comitia tributa , then the focus of popular politics , in 145 BC . Particularly important and unprecedented political events took place in 133 BC when , in the midst of riots in and around the Forum , the Tribune Tiberius Gracchus was lynched there by a group of Senators . </P> <P> In the 80s BC , during the dictatorship of Sulla , major work was done on the Forum including the raising of the plaza level by almost a meter and the laying of permanent marble paving stones . ( Remarkably , this level of the paving was maintained more or less intact for over a millennium : at least until the sack of Rome by Robert Guiscard and his Normans in 1084 , when neglect finally allowed debris to begin to accumulate unabated . ) </P> <P> In 78 BC , the immense Tabularium ( Records Hall ) was built at the Capitoline Hill end of the Forum by order of the consuls for that year , M. Aemilius Lepidus and Q. Lutatius Catulus . In 63 BC , Cicero delivered his famous speech denouncing the companions of the conspirator Catiline at the Forum ( in the Temple of Concord , whose spacious hall was sometimes used as a meeting place by the Senators ) . After the verdict , they were led to their deaths at the Tullianum , the nearby dungeon which was the only known state prison of the ancient Romans . </P> <P> Over time , the Comitium was lost to the ever - growing Curia and to Julius Caesar 's rearrangements before his assassination in 44 BC . That year , two supremely dramatic events were witnessed by the Forum , perhaps the most famous ever to transpire there : Marc Antony 's funeral oration for Caesar ( immortalized in Shakespeare 's famous play ) was delivered from the partially completed speaker 's platform known as the New Rostra and the public burning of Caesar 's body occurred on a site directly across from the Rostra around which the Temple to the Deified Caesar was subsequently built by his great - nephew Octavius ( Augustus ) . Almost two years later , Marc Antony added to the notoriety of the Rostra by publicly displaying the severed head and right hand of his enemy Cicero there . </P> <H3> Roman Empire ( edit ) </H3> Rendering of the Roman Forum as it may have appeared during the Late Empire <P> After Julius Caesar 's death , and the end of the subsequent Civil Wars , Augustus would finish his great - uncle 's work , giving the Forum its final form . This included the southeastern end of the plaza where he constructed the Temple of Divus Iulius and the Arch of Augustus there ( both in 29 BC ) . The Forum was witness to the assassination of a Roman Emperor in 69 AD : Galba had set out from the palace to meet rebels but was so feeble that he had to be carried in a litter . He was immediately met by a troop of his rival Otho 's cavalry near the Lacus Curtius in the Forum , where he was killed . </P> <P> During these early Imperial times , much economic and judicial business transferred away from the Forum to larger and more extravagant structures to the north . After the building of Trajan 's Forum ( 110 AD ) , these activities transferred to the Basilica Ulpia . </P> <P> The white marble Arch of Septimius Severus was added at the northwest end of the Forum close to the foot of the Capitoline Hill and adjacent to the old , vanishing Comitium . It was dedicated in 203 AD to commemorate the Parthian victories of Emperor Septimius Severus and his two sons , and is one of the most visible landmarks there today . The Emperor Diocletian ( r . 284 - 305 ) was the last of the great builders of Rome 's city infrastructure and he did not omit the Forum from his program . By his day it had become highly cluttered with honorific memorials . He refurbished and reorganized it , building anew the Temple of Saturn , Temple of Vesta and the Curia . The last had recently burned and Diocletian 's version is the one that can still be visited today . </P> <P> The reign of Constantine the Great saw the completion of the construction of the Basilica of Maxentius ( 312 AD ) , the last significant expansion of the Forum complex . This restored much of the political focus to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later . </P> <H3> Medieval ( edit ) </H3> <P> The city 's estimated population fell 750 - 800,000 to 450,000 in 450 to 250,000 by 500 A.D. The populated areas contracted to the river . Strenuous efforts were made to keep the Forum ( and the palatine structures ) intact , not without some success . In the 6th century some of the old edifices within the Forum began to be transformed into Christian churches . On 1 August 608 , the Column of Phocas , a Roman monumental column , was erected before the Rostra and dedicated or rededicated in honour of the Eastern Roman Emperor Phocas . This proved to be the last monumental addition made to the Forum . The emperor Constans who visited the city in 665 A.D. stripped the lead roofs which exposed the monumental buildings to the weather and hastened deterioration . By the 8th century the whole space was surrounded by Christian churches taking the place of the abandoned and ruined temples . </P> <P> An anonymous 8th - century traveller from Einsiedeln ( now in Switzerland ) reported that the Forum was already falling apart in his time . During the Middle Ages , though the memory of the Forum Romanum persisted , its monuments were for the most part buried under debris , and its location was designated the `` Campo Vaccino '' or `` cattle field , '' located between the Capitoline Hill and the Colosseum . </P> <P> After the 8th century the structures of the Forum were dismantled , re-arranged and used to build feudal towers and castles within the local area . In the 13th century these rearranged structures were torn down and the site became a dumping ground . This , along with the debris from the dismantled medieval buildings and ancient structures , helped contribute to the rising ground level . </P> <P> The return of Pope Urban V from Avignon in 1367 led to an increased interest in ancient monuments , partly for their moral lesson and partly as a quarry for new buildings being undertaken in Rome after a long lapse . </P> <H3> Excavation and preservation ( edit ) </H3> A detailed archeological layout of the Forum . ( From Platner , 1904 . ) <P> The Roman Forum was a site for many artists and architects studying in Rome to sketch during the 17th through the 19th century . The focus of many of these works produced by visiting Northern artists was on current state of the Roman Forum , known locally as the `` Campo Vaccino '' , or `` cow field '' , due to the livestock who grazed on the largely ignored section of the city . Claude Lorrain 's 1636 `` Campo Vaccino '' shows the extent to which the building in the forum were buried under sediment . From about 1740 to his death in 1772 , the artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi worked on a series of 135 etchings depicting 18th century Rome . Renowned British artist J.M.W. Turner painted `` Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino '' in 1839 , following his final trip to the city . </P> Claude Lorrain 's 1636 `` Campo Vaccino '' ( Louvre , Paris ) J.M.W. Turner ' s 1839 `` Modern Rome - Campo Vacino '' ( Royal Academy , London ) <P> The excavation by Carlo Fea , who began clearing the debris from the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803 marked the beginning of clearing the Forum . Excavations were officially begun in 1898 by the Italian government under the Minister of Public Instruction , Dr. Baccelli . The 1898 restoration had three main objectives : restore fragmented pieces of columns , bases , and cornices to their original locations in the Forum , reach the lowest possible level of the Forum without damaging existing structures , and to identify already half - excavated structures , along with the senate house and Basilica Aemilia . These state - funded excavations were led by Dr. Giacomo Boni until he died in 1925 , stopping briefly during World War I . </P> <P> Today , the Forum is open as a tourist destination along with the Palatine Hill and Colosseum . The excavations are open to the imperial street level , and guided tours are given in multiple languages . The Forum Museum ( Antiquarium Forense ) is found at the Colosseum end of a modern road , the Via dei Fori Imperiali . It has a significant collection of sculpture and architectural fragments . There are also reconstructions of the Forum and the nearby Imperial Fora as well as a short video in several languages . It is entered from the Forum by the side of Santa Francesca Romana ( No. 53 Piazza S. Maria Nova ) and is open from 08 : 30 to one hour before sunset . Admission is 12 euro . </P> <P> In 2008 heavy rains caused structural damage to the modern concrete covering holding the `` Black Stone '' marble together over the Lapis Niger in Rome . Excavations in the forum continue , with new discoveries by archeologists working in the forum since 2009 leading to questions about Rome 's exact age . One of these recent discoveries includes a tufa wall near the Lapis Niger used to channel water from nearby aquifers . Around the wall , pottery remains and food scraps allowed archeologists to date the likely construction of the wall to the 8th or 9th century BC , over a century before the traditional date of Rome 's founding . </P> View of the Roman Forum from Palatine Hill with the Arco de Settimio Severo to the west ( left ) and the Colosseum to the east ( right ) . <H2> Monuments ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of monuments of the Roman Forum Rome : Ruins of the Forum , Looking towards the Capitol ( 1742 ) by Canaletto <P> The Roman Forum has been a source of inspiration for visual artists for centuries . Especially notable is Giambattista Piranesi who created ( 1748 -- 76 ) a set of 135 etchings -- the Vedute di Roma ( Views of Rome ) -- in which the Forum figured significantly . ( Many of the features documented in Piranesi 's views have now vanished . ) </P> <P> Notable artists of the Forum include Maerten van Heemskerck , Pirro Ligorio , Canaletto , Claude Lorrain , Giovanni Paolo Panini , Hubert Robert , J.M.W. Turner and many others . </P> <H3> Temple of Saturn ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Temple of Saturn was one of the more significant buildings located in the Roman Forum . It is believed to have been built in 497 BC and located in Regione VIII Forum Romanum . Little is known about when the Temple was built , as the original temple is believed to have been burnt down by the Gauls early in the fourth century . However it is understood that it was also rebuilt by Munatius Plancus in 42 BC . The eight remaining columns are all that is left of the illustrious temple . Though its exact date of completion is not known , it stands as one of the oldest buildings in the Forum Romanum . The temple originally was to be built to the god Jupiter but was replaced with Saturn ; historians are unsure why . The building was not used solely for religious practice ; the temple also functioned as a bank for the Roman Society . </P> What remains of the Temple of Saturn <P> The Temple stood in the forum along with four other temples . It stood with the Temple of Concord , Vesta , Castor and Pullox . At each temple , animal sacrifices and rituals were done in front of the religious sites . These acts were meant to provide good fortune to those entering and using the temple . Since the Temple of Saturn also functioned as a bank , and since Saturn was the god of the Golden Age , the sacrifices were made in hope of financial success . </P> <P> Inside the Temple there were multiple vaults for the public and private ones for individuals . There were also sections of the Temple for public speaking events and feasts which often followed the sacrifices . </P> <H2> Other fora in Rome ( edit ) </H2> <P> Other fora existed in other areas of the city ; remains of most of them , sometimes substantial , still exist . The most important of these are a number of large imperial fora forming a complex with the Forum Romanum : the Forum Iulium , Forum Augustum , the Forum Transitorium ( also : Forum Nerva ) , and Trajan 's Forum . The planners of the Mussolini era removed most of the Medieval and Baroque strata and built the Via dei Fori Imperiali road between the Imperial Fora and the Forum . There are also : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Forum Boarium , dedicated to the commerce of cattle , between the Palatine Hill and the river Tiber , </Li> <Li> The Forum Holitorium , dedicated to the commerce of herbs and vegetables , between the Capitoline Hill and the Servian walls , </Li> <Li> The Forum Piscarium , dedicated to the commerce of fish , between the Capitoline hill and the Tiber , in the area of the current Roman Ghetto , </Li> <Li> The Forum Suarium , dedicated to the commerce of pork , near the barracks of the cohortes urbanae in the northern part of the Campus Martius , </Li> <Li> The Forum Vinarium , dedicated to the commerce of wine , in the area now of the `` quartiere '' Testaccio , between Aventine Hill and the Tiber . </Li> </Ul> <P> Other markets were known but remain unidentifiable due to a lack of precise information on each site 's function . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Ancient Rome portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Colossus of Constantine , colossal statue formerly in the west apse of the Basilica of Maxentius </Li> <Li> Farnese Gardens ( 1550 ) , immediately overlooking the Forum </Li> <Li> Tarpeian Rock , a traditional execution site overlooking the Forum </Li> <Li> Veduta </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Grant , Michael ( 1970 ) , The Roman Forum , London : Weidenfeld & Nicolson ; Photos by Werner Forman , pg 11 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` La Stampa - La top ten dei monumenti pi\u00f9 visti Primo il Colosseo , seconda Pompei '' .

Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish of Tiberias ( A.D. 230 -- 270 ) , asserted that all the specific names for the angels were brought back by the Jews from Babylon , and modern commentators would tend to agree . </P> <P> Raphael is named in several Jewish apocryphal books . </P> <H3> In the Book of Enoch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Raphael bound Azazel under a desert called Dudael according to Enoch 10 : 4 -- 6 : </P> <P> And again the Lord said to Raphael : `` Bind Azazel hand and foot , and cast him into the darkness : and make an opening in the desert , which is in Dudael , and cast him therein . And place upon him rough and jagged rocks , and cover him with darkness , and let him abide there for ever , and cover his face that he may not see light . And on the day of the great judgment he shall be cast into the fire . '' </P> <P> Of archangels in the angelology of post-Exilic Judaism , only Michael , mentioned as archangel ( Daniel 12 : 1 ) , and Gabriel are mentioned by name in canonical books . </P> <H2> In catholicism and the Orthodox church ( edit ) </H2> Tobias and the Angel by Gustave Dor\u00e9 <P> The name of the angel Raphael appears in the Biblical Book of Tobit . The Book of Tobit is considered deuterocanonical by Catholics , Orthodox , and some Anglicans . Raphael first appears disguised in human form as the travelling companion of Tobit 's son , Tobiah ( Greek : \u03a4\u03c9\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 / Tobias ) , calling himself `` Azarias the son of the great Ananias '' . During the course of the journey the archangel 's protective influence is shown in many ways including the binding of a demon in the desert of upper Egypt . After returning and healing the blind Tobit , Azarias makes himself known as `` the angel Raphael , one of the seven , who stand before the Lord '' Tobit 12 : 15 . He is venerated as Saint Raphael the Archangel . </P> <P> Regarding the healing powers attributed to Raphael , there is his declaration to Tobit ( Tobit , 12 ) that he was sent by the Lord to heal him of his blindness and to deliver Sarah , his future daughter - in - law , from the demon Asmodeus , who kills every man she marries on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated . </P> <P> In the New Testament , only the archangels Gabriel and Michael are mentioned by name ( Luke 1 : 9 -- 26 ; Jude 1 : 9 ) . Later manuscripts of John 5 : 1 -- 4 refer to the pool of Bethesda , where the multitude of the infirm lay awaiting the moving of the water , for `` an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond ; and the water was moved . And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under '' . Because of the healing role assigned to Raphael , this particular angel is generally associated with the archangel . </P> <H3> Veneration ( edit ) </H3> Patronage ( edit ) Raphael , Palazzo Ducale , Venice , detail <P> Due to his actions in the Book of Tobit and the Gospel of John , Saint Raphael is accounted patron of travelers , the blind , happy meetings , nurses , physicians , medical workers , matchmakers , Christian marriage , and Catholic studies . As a particular enemy of the devil , he was revered in Catholic Europe as a special protector of Catholic sailors : on a corner of Venice 's famous Doge 's Palace , there is a relief depicting Raphael holding a scroll on which is written : `` Efficia fretum quietum '' ( Keep the Gulf quiet ) . On July 8 , 1497 , when Vasco Da Gama set forth from Lisbon with his four ship fleet to sail to India , the flagship was named -- at the King of Portugal 's insistence -- the St. Raphael . When the flotilla reached the Cape of Good Hope on October 22 , the sailors disembarked and erected a column in the archangel 's honor . The little statue of St. Raphael that accompanied Da Gama on the voyage is now in the Naval Museum in Lisbon . </P> Iconography ( edit ) <P> Raphael is said to guard pilgrims on their journeys , and is often depicted holding a staff . He is also often depicted holding or standing on a fish , which alludes to his healing of Tobit with the fish 's gall . </P> Feast day ( edit ) <P> The feast day of Raphael was included for the first time in the General Roman Calendar in 1921 , for celebration on October 24 . With the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar , the feast was transferred to September 29 for celebration together with archangels Saints Michael and Gabriel . Due to Pope Benedict XVI 's Summorum Pontificum , the Catholic Church permits , within certain limits for public use , the General Roman Calendar of 1960 , which has October 24 as Raphael 's feast day . </P> Apparitions ( edit ) <P> The Archangel Raphael is said to have appeared in Cordova , Spain , during the 16th century ; in response to the city 's appeal , Pope Innocent X allowed the local celebration of a feast in the Archangel 's honor on May 7 , the date of the principal apparition . Saint John of God , founder of the Hospital order that bears his name , is also said to have received visitations from Saint Raphael , who encouraged and instructed him . In tribute to this , many of the Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God 's facilities are called `` Raphael Centers '' to this day . The 18th century Neapolitan nun , Saint Maria Francesca of the Five Wounds is also said to have seen apparitions of Raphael . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following places have been named in honor of Raphael : </P> <P> Saint Rapha\u00ebl , France ; Saint Rapha\u00ebl , Quebec , Canada ; and San Rafaels in Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Costa Rica , Chile , Mexico , Trinidad and Tobago , Peru , and the Philippines ; also San Rafael de El Moj\u00e1n and San Rafael de Orituco in Venezuela . </P> <Ul> <Li> In the United States , San Rafaels inherited from Spain survive in California ( where besides the city there are the San Rafael Mountains ) </Li> <Li> New Mexico , and Utah , where the San Rafael River flows seasonally in the San Rafael Desert . </Li> <Li> St. Raphael 's Cathedral , the seat of the Diocese of Madison , Wisconsin </Li> <Li> St. Raphael 's Cathedral , the seat of the Archdiocese of Dubuque </Li> <Li> Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel in San Rafael , California . </Li> <Li> St. Raphael 's Church , Huccaby , Hexworthy , Dartmoor National Park , Devon , England </Li> </Ul> <P> The Arcangelo Raffaello youth confraternity functioned in Florence , Italy from its founding in 1411 to its suppression in 1785 . </P> <H2> Popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <P> The angel Raphael , along with many other prominent angels , appears in John Milton 's Paradise Lost , in which he is assigned by God to re-warn Adam concerning the sin of eating of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil . He also expounds to Adam the War in Heaven in which Lucifer and the demons fell , and the creation of the Earth . </P> <P> In Joseph Haydn 's Creation , Raphael ( bass ) is one of the three angelic narrators , along with Gabriel ( soprano ) and Uriel ( tenor ) . </P> <P> Raphael appears in In Nomine as the Angel of Knowledge , a role - playing game centered around the war between Heaven and Hell in the modern day , apparently sacrificing himself to slay the Demon Prince Legion . </P> <P> He also appears as `` Rafael '' in the role - playing game Anima Beyond Fantasy as one of the seven Beryls ( god - like spirits of light , all but one having taken female gender ) . She is identified by the humans with the archangel of the same name and incarnates life and nature . </P> <P> He also appears along with Michael , Gabriel and Uriel as a swan in El Shaddai : Ascension of the Metatron . </P> <P> Archangel Raphael 's famous Indian shrine at Ollur ( Kerala ) which is the largest Kerala parish with more than four thousand families , and the angel himself with Thobias are the chief characters in George Menachery 's short story `` A Walk - out at Midnight '' in which the huge collection of the church 's wooden sculptures become animated . </P> <P> Raphael features as one of the four archangels in the TV series Supernatural . </P> <P> The character Raphael Santiago from Cassandra Clare 's The Mortal Instruments , and the TV series Shadowhunters is named in reference to Raphael . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of angels in theology </Li> <Li> Angels in Judaism </Li> <Li> Archangel </Li> <Li> Feast of Saint Raphael , Ollur </Li> <Li> Gabriel </Li> <Li> Michael ( archangel ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Doctrine and Covenants 128 : 21 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Angels in the Talmud '' , Jewish Heritage Online Magazine </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` The Book of Enoch : The Book of Enoch : Chapter X '' .

The series is about an `` average computer - whiz - next - door '' named Chuck Bartowski , played by Zachary Levi , who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working for the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . The message embeds the only remaining copy of a software program containing the United States ' greatest spy secrets into Chuck 's brain , leading the CIA and the NSA to assign him handlers and use him on top - secret missions . Produced by College Hill Pictures , Fake Empire Productions , Wonderland Sound and Vision , and Warner Bros. Television , the series premiered on September 24 , 2007 , on NBC , airing on Monday nights at 8 : 00 p.m. / 7 : 00 p.m. Central . </P> <P> As the second season finished , flagging ratings put Chuck in danger of cancellation , but fans mounted a successful campaign to encourage NBC to renew the show . The campaign was unique in that fans specifically targeted a sponsor of the show , the Subway restaurant chain , leading to the chain striking a major sponsorship deal with NBC to help cover costs of the third season . The series ' renewal was uncertain in each subsequent season . The fifth season was the last , beginning on October 28 , 2011 , and moving to Friday nights at 8 p.m. / 7 Central . The series concluded on January 27 , 2012 with a two - hour finale . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Episodes </Li> <Li> 2 Cast and characters <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Main cast </Li> <Li> 2.2 Recurring cast </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Conception </Li> <Li> 3.2 Casting </Li> <Li> 3.3 Filming locations </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Ratings </Li> <Li> 4.2 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 4.3 Awards and honors </Li> <Li> 4.4 Campaign for series renewal , 2009 </Li> <Li> 4.5 Series renewal , 2010 </Li> <Li> 4.6 Series renewal , 2011 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Broadcast and distribution <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Broadcast history </Li> <Li> 5.2 Online distribution </Li> <Li> 5.3 Home media </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Other media <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Marketing </Li> <Li> 6.2 Comics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Possible film </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Chuck episodes <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Season </Th> <Th> Episodes </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Originally aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> First aired </Th> <Th> Last aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> <Td> September 24 , 2007 ( 2007 - 09 - 24 ) </Td> <Td> January 24 , 2008 ( 2008 - 01 - 24 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> <Td> September 29 , 2008 ( 2008 - 09 - 29 ) </Td> <Td> April 27 , 2009 ( 2009 - 04 - 27 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> January 10 , 2010 ( 2010 - 01 - 10 ) </Td> <Td> May 24 , 2010 ( 2010 - 05 - 24 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 24 </Td> <Td> September 20 , 2010 ( 2010 - 09 - 20 ) </Td> <Td> May 16 , 2011 ( 2011 - 05 - 16 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> <Td> October 28 , 2011 ( 2011 - 10 - 28 ) </Td> <Td> January 27 , 2012 ( 2012 - 01 - 27 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Chuck Bartowski ( Zachary Levi ) is in his mid-twenties and works at Buy More , a Burbank , California consumer - electronics chain store . He is an intelligent , but unmotivated , computer service expert and works alongside his best friend , Morgan Grimes ( Joshua Gomez ) . He had been expelled from Stanford University on false charges that he cheated in one of his classes , which likely damaged his drive and morale . His sister , Ellie ( Sarah Lancaster ) , and her boyfriend , Devon `` Captain Awesome '' Woodcomb ( Ryan McPartlin ) , are doctors who constantly encourage Chuck to make progress in his professional and romantic life . </P> <P> Bryce Larkin ( Matthew Bomer ) , Chuck 's former Stanford University roommate and now a Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) agent , steals the Intersect , the entire merged database of the CIA and National Security Agency ( NSA ) , and destroys the computer storing it . The sole surviving copy becomes subliminally embedded in Chuck 's brain via encoded images when he opens an email from Bryce . The NSA 's Major John Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) and CIA Agent Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski ) are dispatched to investigate . </P> <P> Chuck is recruited to use the knowledge he now possesses to help thwart assassins and international terrorists , upending his previously mundane life . The Intersect causes Chuck to receive involuntary `` flashes '' of information from the database , activated by triggers such as faces , voices , objects , and keywords . In order to protect his family and friends , Chuck must keep his second occupation a secret . Casey and Walker are assigned to watch over Chuck . They are forced to establish an uneasy alliance and cover - identities . Walker poses as Chuck 's girlfriend and takes a job at a fast food restaurant near the Buy More . Casey reluctantly becomes part of the Buy More sales team . </P> <P> The main antagonists driving the plot are a series of rogue spy cabals , first internal to the United States intelligence community and then global in scope . A core part of the threat is the danger of the Intersect being either captured , making Chuck as much a liability as an asset to the government , or replicated , making Chuck obsolete or outmatched by less scrupulous spies . </P> <P> Chuck , Sarah , and Casey all face professional conflicts as they grow to respect each other . A genuine romantic interest develops between Chuck and Sarah . Chuck 's desire to maintain his close relationships and eventually return to a normal life is challenged by the dangers and growing responsibilities of his secret life , so that he gradually becomes a more competent , confident , and willing spy . In later seasons , upgrades to the Intersect would include skills in espionage as well as information ( the reason the Intersect was originally conceived ) , giving Chuck temporary knowledge of hand - to - hand combat and other skills such as playing the guitar , using a zipline , foreign languages , dancing , and firearms training . </P> <P> In the course of events , Chuck unravels mysteries from his life before the series , often dealing with the Intersect , such as why his parents left , why Bryce got him kicked out of Stanford , and why he 's unusually suited for the Intersect . Meanwhile , Casey and Sarah confront unresolved issues from their lives before the series , including their families , Sarah 's history with Bryce , and the spies they previously worked with . And as Chuck grows more comfortable with his own role , those closest to him are gradually drawn into his spy life . </P> <H2> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Chuck characters See also : List of Chuck cast members <H3> Main cast ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Character </Th> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th_colspan=\"5\"> Seasons </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Charles Irving `` Chuck '' Bartowski </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi </Td> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Agent Sarah Walker </Td> <Td> Yvonne Strahovski </Td> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Colonel John Casey </Td> <Td> Adam Baldwin </Td> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Morgan Grimes </Td> <Td> Joshua Gomez </Td> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dr. Eleanor `` Ellie '' Bartowski </Td> <Td> Sarah Lancaster </Td> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dr. Devon `` Captain Awesome '' Woodcomb </Td> <Td> Ryan McPartlin </Td> <Td> Recurring </Td> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Michael `` Big Mike '' Tucker </Td> <Td> Mark Christopher Lawrence </Td> <Td> Recurring </Td> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Lester Patel </Td> <Td> Vik Sahay </Td> <Td> Recurring </Td> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jeffrey `` Jeff '' Barnes </Td> <Td> Scott Krinsky </Td> <Td> Recurring </Td> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> Main </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Brigadier General Diane Beckman </Td> <Td> Bonita Friedericy </Td> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> Recurring </Td> <Td> Main </Td> <Td> Recurring </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Anna Wu </Td> <Td> Julia Ling </Td> <Td> Recurring </Td> <Td> Main </Td> <Td> Guest </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Recurring cast ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Tony Todd as CIA Director Langston Graham ( seasons 1 , 2 and 5 ) </Li> <Li> Matthew Bomer as Bryce Larkin ( seasons 1 and 2 ) </Li> <Li> C.S.

It 's a combination of one part The Office , one part 24 , one part Alias . When you mash those shows together , what happens ? What we were really excited about is if you built the show like something like The Office , where you essentially met all these characters and you loved them , and then how terrifying it would be if Sydney Bristow or Jack Bauer suddenly came into The Office , because you knew , when those people showed up , that someone was going to get shot , and someone was going to get tortured , and someone was going to get killed . That 's where the initial germ of the Chuck show came from . <P> -- Co-creator Chris Fedak </P> <P> Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak wrote the script for the first episode , which was initially given a put pilot commitment by NBC before a pilot order was green lit by the network in January 2007 . Schwartz and Fedak both attended the University of Southern California . Fedak pitched the idea to Schwartz , who agreed to develop the project with him . Joseph McGinty Nichol , Schwartz 's fellow executive producer on The O.C. , directed the first hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his production company , Wonderland Sound and Vision . Fedak , Peter Johnson , Scott Rosenbaum , Matthew Miller , and Allison Adler also serve as co-executive producers . NBC gave the series an early pick - up and a thirteen - episode order on May 10 , 2007 . On November 26 , 2007 , TV Guide reported that NBC had picked up the series for a full , 22 episode season . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> Zachary Levi and Adam Baldwin were the first two to be cast in February 2007 in the roles of Chuck Bartowski and veteran NSA agent Major John Casey , respectively . Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role of John Casey and the producers found that the actor was a `` perfect fit '' for the character during the first casting session . Relative newcomer Yvonne Strahovski was chosen for the female lead role of what was then CIA officer Sarah Kent in the same month . Casting continued throughout March with Sarah Lancaster , Joshua Gomez , and Natalie Martinez landing the parts of Dr. Ellie Bartowski ( Chuck 's older sister ) , Morgan Pace ( Chuck 's best friend ) , and Kayla Hart ( Chuck 's neighbor and love interest ) , respectively . The Kayla Hart character was dropped before filming because creators Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz found it unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women would be pining over Chuck . Morgan 's surname was later changed to `` Grimes '' and Sarah 's surname was changed to `` Walker '' . </P> <H3> Filming Locations ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although Chuck 's apartment is set in Echo Park , the pilot was shot in El Cabrillo in Hollywood . After the series was picked up , the apartment and the building 's courtyard were re-created on a Warner Bros. soundstage . Aerial views throughout the show combine shots of Echo Park and El Cabrillo . </P> <P> The exterior shots of the Burbank Buy More where Chuck and Morgan work are of a former Mervyn 's store in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Ratings ( edit ) </H3> U.S. viewers for each episode in the series , broken down into its five seasons . <P> Despite heavy promotion from NBC and positive critical reviews , Chuck suffered in domestic ratings due to stiff competition from established hits from ABC ( Dancing with the Stars ) , Fox ( House ) , and CBS ( How I Met Your Mother , Rules of Engagement ) in the Monday 8 : 00 -- 9 : 00 pm ET timeslot . Its ratings were also affected by the 2007 -- 2008 Writers Guild of America strike in the first season and President Barack Obama 's prime time news conference that led to the show being preempted for a week in the second season , shortly after NBC had done heavy promotion for the show around the Super Bowl . In May 2010 , it was reported that Chuck ranked in the top 20 TV shows in the SocialSenseTV ratings report of social media interactions , measuring posts and reads on forums , blogs , and other social media over a three - month period . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Season </Th> <Th> Timeslot ( EDT ) </Th> <Th> Season premiere </Th> <Th> Season finale </Th> <Th> TV season </Th> <Th> Rank </Th> <Th> U.S. viewers in millions </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Monday 8 : 00 p.m. </Td> <Td> September 24 , 2007 </Td> <Td> January 24 , 2008 </Td> <Td> 2007 -- 2008 </Td> <Td> # 65 </Td> <Td> 8.68 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Monday 8 : 00 p.m. </Td> <Td> September 29 , 2008 </Td> <Td> April 27 , 2009 </Td> <Td> 2008 -- 2009 </Td> <Td> # 71 </Td> <Td> 7.36 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Monday 8 : 00 p.m. </Td> <Td> January 10 , 2010 </Td> <Td> May 24 , 2010 </Td> <Td> 2009 -- 2010 </Td> <Td> # 82 </Td> <Td> 5.99 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Monday 8 : 00 p.m. </Td> <Td> September 20 , 2010 </Td> <Td> May 16 , 2011 </Td> <Td> 2010 -- 2011 </Td> <Td> # 101 </Td> <Td> 5.58 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> Friday 8 : 00 p.m. </Td> <Td> October 28 , 2011 </Td> <Td> January 27 , 2012 </Td> <Td> 2011 -- 2012 </Td> <Td> # 138 </Td> <Td> 4.25 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> Chuck has received critical acclaim . Rolling Stone magazine included the show on its fall 2007 `` We Like to Watch '' list , saying the show `` wipes the floor with the other fall debuts '' . Chuck landed on USA Today 's list of the `` 10 Picks for 2007 '' and they called Levi 's performance `` incredibly winning '' , giving the comedy three - out - of - four stars . Chuck drew numerous comparisons to another critically acclaimed comedy that debuted in Fall 2007 -- Reaper -- which also starred a twenty - something underachiever who works in a large retail , `` big - box '' store ( Work Bench ) and is drawn into heroism against his will . </P> <P> As 2008 drew to a close , the show received further acclaim . In December Time magazine named the show one of the top 10 TV series of the year . It also made the year - end top 10 list of the Chicago Tribune , Television Without Pity 's list of TV Shows We Wish More People Watched , The Star - Ledger 's Top TV shows of 2008 ( # 4 ) , The Miami Herald 's TV 's Top 5 list , The New York Observer 's Top 10 TV Shows of the Year ( # 6 ) , and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette mentions Chuck as one of the few bright spots in television in 2008 . </P> <P> The Chicago Tribune 's Maureen Ryan wrote that `` the show pays attention to the mechanics of storytelling and does n't just try to coast on the comedy . '' She continued , `` ( Given ) the level of attention paid to all those other things -- emotion , suspense , plotting , character -- Chuck ends up being one of the TV scene 's greatest pleasures at the moment . '' Television Without Pity 's Angel Cohn finds Chuck to be a well - written show , saying `` it features some of the smartest and most quick - witted dialogue on TV '' . She praises the ensemble cast and notes `` while the first season was good , this show has really hit its stride in its second season . '' James Poniewozik of Time magazine says the show is a `` delight '' and that with the second season the `` new episodes quickly jump back in , with higher stakes and sharper jokes . '' The Star - Ledger 's Alan Sepinwall calls Chuck `` the most purely entertaining show currently on television , whether you 're talking network or cable . '' He states that `` what makes Chuck so special ... is that there 's a fundamental warmth and humanity underneath the jokes '' , with `` a cast of appealing characters played by very good actors . '' </P> <P> Going into 2010 , Aaron Barnhart of the Kansas City Star described the show 's premise as `` fresh , appealing and limited '' , expressing concern that `` a lot of TV shows overstay their welcome '' and fearing that in its third season the show is `` about to run out of new , workable ideas '' . USA Today called the show NBC 's `` best scripted hour '' . </P> <P> In an article in The Journal of Popular Culture , Joseph J. Darowski recognizes the series ' exploration of technology 's impact on individual identity . He discusses the series ' themes as a natural progression of the popular culture tradition of man - made technology encroaching first into nature , then into human bodies , and finally into human minds . </P> <H3> Awards and honors ( edit ) </H3> <P> Season 1 of Chuck enjoyed much formal recognition . The program was mentioned multiple times in IGN 's 2007 year - in - review awards . Along with winning the honor of Best New TV Series , Sarah Walker won the award for best TV character , and Chuck and Sarah as a couple won the `` Couple That We Rooted for the Most '' award . Chuck was also nominated for `` Best New TV Comedy Series '' at the 2008 People 's Choice Awards , which aired on January 8 , 2008 , but lost to Samantha Who ? The series stunt coordinator Merritt Yohnka won the 2007 -- 2008 Primetime Emmy for `` Outstanding Stunt Coordination '' . Chuck was also nominated for `` Outstanding Main Title Design '' in 2007 , but did not win . Merritt Yohnka also won the 2008 -- 2009 Primetime Emmy for `` Outstanding Stunt Coordination '' , back - to - back wins for the same award . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Nominee ( s ) </Th> <Th> Result </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> ALMA Award </Td> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> Outstanding Male Performance in a Comedy Television Series </Td> <Td> Joshua Gomez </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2009 </Td> <Td> Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> American Cinema Editors </Td> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> Best Edited One - Hour Series for Commercial Television </Td> <Td> Norman Buckley </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Casting Society of America </Td> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Outstanding Achievement in Casting -- Television Pilot -- Comedy </Td> <Td> Patrick Rush </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Image Awards </Td> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for `` The Couch Lock '' </Td> <Td> Michael Shultz </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Emmy Awards </Td> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> Outstanding Stunt Coordination </Td> <Td> Merritt Yohnka </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Outstanding Main Title Design </Td> <Td> Karin Fong Jonathan Gershon Dana Yee </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2009 </Td> <Td> Outstanding Stunt Coordination </Td> <Td> Merritt Yohnka </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Outstanding Stunt Coordination </Td> <Td> Merritt Yohnka </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> SFX Awards </Td> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Best Actress </Td> <Td> Yvonne Strahovski </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> People 's Choice Awards </Td> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> Favorite New TV Comedy </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Satellite Awards </Td> <Td> 2007 </Td> <Td> Best Actor in a Series , Comedy or Musical </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Television Series , Comedy or Musical </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> TV Guide Awards </Td> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Favorite Actress </Td> <Td> Yvonne Strahovski </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Favorite Couple Who Have </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi & Yvonne Strahovski </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Favorite Villain </Td> <Td> Timothy Dalton </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Saturn Award </Td> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> Best Actor on Television </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Network Television Series </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Teen Choice Awards </Td> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> Choice TV Breakout Star Male </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Actor -- Action </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Actress -- Action </Td> <Td> Yvonne Strahovski </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Choice TV Show : Action </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Actor -- Action </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Actress -- Action </Td> <Td> Yvonne Strahovski </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Choice TV Show : Action </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> Actor -- Action </Td> <Td> Zachary Levi </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> Actress -- Action </Td> <Td> Yvonne Strahovski </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> Choice TV Show : Action </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Young Artist Awards </Td> <Td> 2009 </Td> <Td> Best Performance in a TV Series -- Guest Starring Young Actress </Td> <Td> Stefanie Scott </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> IGN </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Best of 2010 -- Best Villain </Td> <Td> Brandon Routh </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Campaign for series renewal , 2009 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite being one of the first series to be renewed by NBC for the 2008 -- 2009 television season , Chuck was classified as a show `` on the bubble '' between renewal and cancellation in April 2009 after NBC decided to delay its decision on its renewal for a third season until early May . The show 's second season did not improve on or maintain the audience numbers received in the first season and has consistently obtained low ratings , making it one of the least - watched shows in its Monday 8 : 00 pm ET timeslot . Concerned that the show would not be renewed for a third season , fans launched a `` Save Chuck '' campaign that gained momentum with the use of social - networking websites like Twitter and Facebook . </P> <P> Fansite ChuckTV.net launched the first organized fan effort , the Watch / Buy / Share campaign ( an idea thought up by `` Chuck , vs the podcast '' founder Gray Jones ) , on March 18 , 2009 ; a letter writing campaign was later added to the effort . The week of April 6 , 2009 , television blogger Kath Skerry changed the name of her website GiveMeMyRemote.com to GiveMeMyChuck.com and used Twitter to notify her readers to support the show , prompting television columnists Alan Sepinwall of The Star - Ledger , Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune and Josef Adalian of TelevisionWeek to write Chuck - related news on their websites and Twitter feeds . Sepinwall also wrote an open letter to NBC on reasons for renewal , while Ryan encouraged fan support by listing the various ways in which they could contribute to the campaign to save Chuck . One fan , Wendy Farrington , was inspired by a product placement in second - season episodes to organize a campaign to purchase `` Footlong '' submarine sandwiches from Subway on the air date of the second - season finale . This movement gained support from various cast and crew members , with actor Zachary Levi seen leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in Birmingham , England . Members of the show 's cast and crew participated in a special `` rally cry '' episode of Chuck vs the Podcast on April 24 , 2009 , just before the season finale , to encourage fans to keep the campaign going and thank them for their support . On the campaign , co-creator Josh Schwartz remarked that it `` has been one of the most amazing experiences of ( his ) life to witness -- and certainly the most creatively gratifying '' . Other fan efforts include the `` Have a Heart , Renew Chuck '' campaign , involving Chuck fans donating money to the American Heart Association on behalf of NBC . By the NBC Upfront on May 19 , 2009 over $17,000 was raised . </P> <P> The campaign also prompted press and media coverage , with The Hollywood Reporter calling Chuck the `` most discussed bubble show online '' . Linda Holmes , writing for NPR , noted the support the campaign has received from both fans and critics , and comments : `` It 's very common for chasms to open between critics and viewers ... But here , critics find themselves passionately advocating for something that 's extraordinarily enjoyable to watch . '' James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote about the efficacy of save - this - show columns and fan protests , saying , `` The sad fact of advertising - supported television is that , unlike cable , it still rewards breadth , not depth , of viewership . Four million people who watch a show really hard are still just four million people to an ad buyer . Unless they spend money . '' He stated that the `` Finale & Footlong '' campaign was a far more effective way to demonstrate support since Subway is one of the show 's major sponsors . However , Josh Bernoff of Advertising Age remarks , `` Thousands of visible , loyal viewers does not equal millions of actual viewers . Objects in the groundswell may be smaller than they appear . People who congregate online are not a representative sample . '' </P> <P> In support of the show , Nestl\u00e9 sent more than 1,000 packs of its Wonka Nerds candies to NBC after Josh Schwartz made such a suggestion to fans in an April 20 , 2009 interview with The New York Times . Additionally , Chuck won the annual `` Save Our Shows '' poll by USA Today in which 43,000 people voted , topping the poll with 54 % of respondents favoring renewal , beating other bubble shows such as Cold Case ( 45 % ) and Without a Trace ( 41 % ) . The petition campaigns were also mentioned on the May 12 , 2009 episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . </P> <P> NBC 's decision to renew the show for a thirteen - episode third season was announced on May 17 , 2009 . Both NBC 's Ben Silverman and co-creator Chris Fedak have confirmed that the option remains for a pickup of nine more episodes . Although Silverman has claimed that NBC is not looking to lower costs , Schwartz has stated that series production studio Warner Bros. Television had asked the producers to make budget cuts to meet a decrease in the license fee by NBC . Silverman , Fedak and Schwartz have all stated that the show 's quality will not be impacted . </P> <P> On October 28 , 2009 , numerous media sources began to run reports that NBC had picked up an additional six episodes . </P> <H3> Series renewal , 2010 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Questions about the series ' continued viability began before the third season aired . Just hours before the third - season premiere , when asked whether NBC suddenly moving Jay Leno out of primetime lowered the bar for Chuck , NBC chairman Jeff Gaspin replied , `` I would n't say the bar 's lower , but we obviously have less choice at the moment , so he 's got a better shot . '' </P> <P> When asked about the series ' chances of being renewed for a fourth season and whether fans would have to step in again , Angela Bromstad replied , `` Well , it 's got to maintain , and it depends on development , '' but said that the show is a `` pleasant surprise , and they 're doing great work . '' </P> <P> The ratings for Chuck slipped , falling to a series - low 1.9 demo for two weeks running as of the 11th episode of the season , `` Chuck Versus the Final Exam . '' The `` TV By The Numbers '' website reported on March 23 , 2010 that this was `` below the ratings level that would indicate likely renewal now '' despite the overall ratings difficulties that NBC was facing . However , on March 30 , 2010 , the season 's 12th episode , `` Chuck Versus the American Hero '' saw an increase to a 2.1 share and a 0.2 million viewer rise . </P> <P> Chuck was also a contestant in E ! 's online Save One Show contest for the second year running , where it won with 52 % of the vote . The runner up was One Tree Hill , which garnered 20 % of the vote . </P> <P> On May 13 , 2010 , it was announced that Chuck had been renewed by NBC for a fourth season . The season received a 13 - episode order with an option of an additional nine episodes . The fourth season premiered during NBC 's fall 2010 schedule . It retained its current timeslot . The premiere episode of the fourth season was titled `` Chuck Versus the Anniversary '' , and aired on September 20 . Season four guest starred Linda Hamilton , Dolph Lundgren , Harry Dean Stanton , Olivia Munn , Steve Austin , Dave Batista , Summer Glau , Timothy Dalton and Eric Roberts . It was announced on October 19 , 2010 that NBC had ordered an additional 11 episodes of Chuck , bringing the episode total for Season 4 to 24 . </P> <P> Speculating on the possibility of a fifth season , Yvonne Strahovski ( Sarah Walker ) commented that she felt `` ... ( the chances ) are pretty good , I will be surprised if we do n't get a season five . '' Her co-star Adam Baldwin ( John Casey ) concurred . </P> <H3> Series renewal , 2011 ( edit ) </H3> <P> It was announced on May 13 , 2011 that Chuck would be renewed for a fifth , and final , season consisting of thirteen episodes , set to premiere on October 21 , 2011 . The show was moved from Monday and aired on Friday nights , in what some consider to be a Friday night death slot . The premiere was later pushed a week later to October 28 . </P> <H2> Broadcast and distribution ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Broadcast history ( edit ) </H3> Main article : List of Chuck episodes <P> The first showing of the pilot occurred on July 27 , 2007 at Comic - Con International in San Diego .

England won the game by nine runs to secure their fourth World Cup title , with Anya Shrubsole named player of the match . It was one of the closest finals in tournament history , with only the 2000 final being decided by a narrower margin . </P> <P> The final was played at Lord 's Cricket Ground , London , on 23 July 2017 . Lord 's had been announced as the host on 8 February 2016 . The game was sold out , with a near - capacity crowd of around 24,000 in attendance . The bell to signal the start of play was rung by Eileen Ash , who at 105 years old is the oldest surviving international cricketer . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Significance </Li> <Li> 1.2 Route to the final </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Teams </Li> <Li> 3 Match <Ul> <Li> 3.1 England innings </Li> <Li> 3.2 India innings </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Significance ( edit ) </H3> <P> England were playing in the Women 's World Cup Final for the fifth time , a mark surpassed only by Australia . However , in the preceding five tournaments ( 1997 -- 2013 ) , England had made the final just once , defeating New Zealand in the 2009 final to claim their third World Cup title . India on the other hand was playing in the World Cup Final , only for the second time in their history . The first had been a loss to Australia in 2005 . </P> <H3> Route to the final ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 2017 Women 's Cricket World Cup <P> The group stage of the 2017 World Cup consisted of a simple round - robin , with each of the eight teams playing each other once and the top four teams progressing to the semi-finals . In the opening match of the tournament , India unexpectedly defeated England by 35 runs . However , England went on to win all six of their remaining group - stage games , finishing top of the table -- with the same number of points as Australia but a superior net run rate . India finished third in the group stage , after losses to South Africa ( by 115 runs ) and Australia ( by eight wickets ) . </P> <P> In the first semi-final , played on 18 July at Bristol County Ground , England defeated South Africa by two wickets . South Africa batted first , posting a score of 218 / 6 from their 50 overs . Towards the end of their innings , England required three runs from the final over to win , with Anya Shrubsole hitting the winning runs off Shabnim Ismail with just two balls to spare . </P> <P> The second semi-final , played at The County Ground , Derby , was reduced to 42 overs per side due to rain . India posted a score of 281 / 4 , with Harmanpreet Kaur scoring 171 ( not out ) from 115 balls , including seven sixes . This was the highest individual score in the knockout stages of a World Cup , and was widely heralded as one of the greatest ever World Cup innings . In response , Australia was bowled out for 245 , leaving India the victors by 36 runs . </P> <H2> Teams ( edit ) </H2> See also : 2017 Women 's Cricket World Cup squads <P> Each team had 15 players in its tournament squad , 11 of whom played in the final . Both teams selected the same line - up for the final as they used in their semi-finals . Only five selected players had previously played in a World Cup final -- Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami for India , and Katherine Brunt , Laura Marsh , and Sarah Taylor for England . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> England </Th> <Th> India </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Heather Knight ( c ) </Li> <Li> Tamsin Beaumont </Li> <Li> Katherine Brunt </Li> <Li> Jenny Gunn </Li> <Li> Alex Hartley </Li> <Li> Laura Marsh </Li> <Li> Natalie Sciver </Li> <Li> Anya Shrubsole </Li> <Li> Sarah Taylor ( wk ) </Li> <Li> Fran Wilson </Li> <Li> Lauren Winfield </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Georgia Elwiss </Li> <Li> Danielle Hazell </Li> <Li> Beth Langston </Li> <Li> Danielle Wyatt </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Coach : Mark Robinson </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Mithali Raj ( c ) </Li> <Li> Rajeshwari Gayakwad </Li> <Li> Jhulan Goswami </Li> <Li> Harmanpreet Kaur </Li> <Li> Veda Krishnamurthy </Li> <Li> Smriti Mandhana </Li> <Li> Shikha Pandey </Li> <Li> Poonam Raut </Li> <Li> Deepti Sharma </Li> <Li> Sushma Verma ( wk ) </Li> <Li> Poonam Yadav </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Ekta Bisht </Li> <Li> Mansi Joshi </Li> <Li> Mona Meshram </Li> <Li> Nuzhat Parween </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Coach : Tushar Arothe </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Match ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> 23 July 2017 10 : 30 Scorecard </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> England 228 / 7 ( 50 overs ) </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> India 219 ( 48.4 overs ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Natalie Sciver 51 ( 68 balls ) Jhulan Goswami 3 / 23 ( 10 overs ) </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Poonam Raut 86 ( 115 balls ) Anya Shrubsole 6 / 46 ( 9.4 overs ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> England won by 9 runs Lord 's , London Umpires : Gregory Brathwaite ( WI ) and Shaun George ( SA ) Player of the match : Anya Shrubsole ( Eng ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> England won the toss and elected to bat . </Li> </Ul> <H3> England innings ( edit ) </H3> Jhulan Goswami was India 's best bowler , finishing with 3 / 23 from 10 overs . <P> England 's captain Heather Knight won the toss and elected to bat . Their openers , Lauren Winfield ( 24 runs ) and Tammy Beaumont ( 23 ) , made steady progress , putting on 47 runs before Winfield was bowled by Rajeshwari Gayakwad . Beaumont was out three overs later , caught in the deep off the bowling of Poonam Yadav . This brought Heather Knight ( 1 ) to the crease , but she lasted just seven balls before also being dismissed by Yadav , leg before wicket ( lbw ; via DRS ) . Sarah Taylor ( 45 ) and Natalie Sciver ( 51 ) steadied the ship somewhat , putting on 83 runs for the fourth wicket whilst light rain fell . With the score at 146 , Taylor was caught behind from the bowling of Jhulan Goswami . Goswami then had Fran Wilson out next ball , for a golden duck . Sciver also fell to Goswami a few overs later , unsuccessfully challenging an lbw decision . Katherine Brunt ( 34 ) and Jenny Gunn ( 25 not out ) put on 32 runs for the seventh wicket before Brunt was run out by Goswami with a direct hit . Gunn continued on with Laura Marsh ( 14 not out ) for the last four overs , with England finishing on 228 / 7 from their 50 overs . Jhulan Goswami was the pick of the Indian bowlers , finished with 3 / 23 . </P> <H3> India innings ( edit ) </H3> <P> India lost a wicket in their second over , with Smriti Mandhana bowled by Anya Shrubsole for a duck . Poonam Raut ( 86 runs ) and Mithali Raj ( 17 ) then put on 38 runs before Raj was run out by Natalie Sciver . Raut and Harmanpreet Kaur ( 51 ) compiled a 95 - run fourth - wicket partnership , lasting just over 20 overs , before Kaur was caught in the deep off the bowling of Alex Hartley . Raut then combined with Veda Krishnamurthy ( 35 ) for an additional 53 runs . Raut 's dismissal with the score at 191 prompted a batting collapse , with India losing their final seven wickets for just 28 runs . As the match reached its climax , India required 11 runs from the last two overs , but instead lost their last two wickets in the first four balls of the 49th over , bowled by Anya Shrubsole . Shrubsole -- the player of the match -- finished with 6 / 46 from 9.4 overs , the best bowling figures in any World Cup final . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ England have finished in the top two of seven separate World Cups , but at the first two tournaments no final was played . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ South African to umpire in WWC Final , ESPNcricinfo , 22 July 2017 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Lord 's to host 2017 Women 's World Cup final '' .

    "document_text": "Middle Island ( Lake Erie ) - wikipedia <H1> Middle Island ( Lake Erie ) </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Map of Pelee island and Middle Island . <P> Middle Island is a small island , just 18.5 hectares ( 46 acres ) in size . It is the southernmost point of land in Canada , located at 41 \u00b0 41'N , 82 \u00b0 41 `` W ( 41.685 , - 82.684 ) , or about 41.7 degrees north latitude . It lies in Lake Erie , just south of Pelee Island , and is part of Point Pelee National Park . It forms part of the province of Ontario . The southernmost part of the island lies some 150 metres ( 164 yards ) from the U.S. maritime boundary . The distance to the northernmost point of land in Canada -- Cape Columbia , Ellesmere Island -- is 4,640 kilometres ( 2,883 miles ) . </P> <P> The southernmost point of Middle Island is at a latitude of North 41 \u00b0 40'53 `` , which is at a slightly lower latitude than the southernmost point in Michigan and slightly farther south than downtown Chicago . Twenty - seven U.S. states lie all or partly north of this point , as do European cities such as Rome and Barcelona . Thirteen states are entirely north of this latitude ( Alaska , Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan , Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine ) . California , albeit only its northernmost edge , is one of the states that lies partially north of Middle Island , as the California / Oregon border is at the 42nd parallel north . </P> Oblique view of Middle Island <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are no permanent settlements on Middle Island , as the entire island is a conservation area . The most common species are double - crested cormorants , though several others also nest there . The birds are so plentiful that in May 2008 , Parks Canada attempted to cull the number of cormorants from more than 4000 nests to between 400 and 800 . It once was the site of a lighthouse , built in 1872 but which fell into disuse by 1918 . </P> <P> The 15 - metre ( 49 ft ) pyramidal square tower burned sometime afterward , but its stone foundation is visible . Located in Canadian waters , and hence indisputably under Canadian sovereignty , the island was privately owned for years by various U.S. owners . Subsequently , Middle Island was purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada , and then donated to the Canadian national park system on September 6 , 2000 . </P> <P> Archaeological evidence from a study done in 1982 suggests human occupation dating from 1000 - 1500 A.D. , with one site containing remains that may date to 500 B.C. Others claim that the island has seen inhabitation for more than 10,000 years . Despite early rumours of burial mounds , none were found . </P> <P> The island is part of an archipelago across western Lake Erie , providing a natural migratory corridor for birds and other animals . It has also seen human migrations , mainly from the U.S. northward in the 19th century , including escaped slaves , prisoners of war and army deserters from the U.S. Civil War seeking asylum in mainland Ontario . </P> <P> Throughout the later decades of the 19th century , parts of Middle Island were used for growing grapes to be used in the production of wine , as was being done on Pelee Island . </P> <P> During Prohibition , the island was a way station for alcohol en route to the United States on the south shore of Lake Erie . Gangster Joe Roscoe acquired part of the island and built a seven - bedroom `` clubhouse '' that became the centre of rum - running activity . The hotel offered electricity , fireplaces , and a large screened - in porch with views of the lake . The basement held a casino , carved out of solid bedrock . </P> <P> In the years after 1933 , after the ratification of the Twenty - first Amendment to the United States Constitution resulted in the repeal of the Volstead Act , the hotel drew as many as 200 visitors a day in peak season . Its kitchen became known for pheasant dinners . </P> <P> Likely prior to the 1950s , there was an airstrip of about 275 metres ( 900 feet ) in length . The runway began and ended in water , and is now choked with vegetation . </P> <P> There was at one time a stately mansion on the island , rumoured to be a brothel some time after Prohibition . Only a remnant of the foundation remains . </P> <P> When purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada , the island had no physical improvements and had essentially become a nature preserve over the last ten years , hosting the occasional scientific visit , and curious boaters . Although part of Point Pelee National Park , Middle Island is not officially open to visitors . </P> <P> Interest in preserving the island prompted a 1982 study by Parks Canada , which recommended naming it a national natural landmark . Its ecological , historical , and aesthetic value led Essex County to include it on its list of Environmentally Sensitive Areas and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest . A conservation group , Carolinian Canada Coalition , named Middle Island one of 38 critical unprotected sites in its effort to preserve remnants of Ontario 's southern forests . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Middle Island Point Pelee National Park of Canada '' .

Benz made the 1886 Benz Patent Motorwagen , which is widely regarded as the first automobile . Gottlieb Daimler , founder of Daimler - Motoren - Gesellschaft . <P> Mercedes - Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz 's creation of the first petrol - powered car , the Benz Patent Motorwagen , financed by Bertha Benz and patented in January 1886 , and Gottlieb Daimler and engineer Wilhelm Maybach 's conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year . The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler - Motoren - Gesellschaft ( Daimler Motors Corporation ) . </P> <P> Emil Jellinek , an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG , created the trademark in 1902 , naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek . Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted `` horseless '' Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society in his adopted home , which , at that time , was a meeting place for the `` Haute Vol\u00e9e '' of France and Europe , especially in winter . His customers included the Rothschild family and other well - known personalities . But Jellinek 's plans went further : as early as 1901 , he was selling Mercedes cars in the New World as well , including US billionaires Rockefeller , Astor , Morgan and Taylor . At a race in Nice in 1899 , Jellinek drove under the pseudonym `` Monsieur Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s '' , a way of concealing the competitor 's real name as was normal in those days . The race ranks as the hour of birth of the Mercedes - Benz brand . In 1901 , the name `` Mercedes '' was registered by Daimler - Motoren - Gesellschaft ( DMG ) worldwide as a protected trademark . The first Mercedes - Benz brand name vehicles were produced in 1926 , following the merger of Karl Benz 's and Gottlieb Daimler 's companies into the Daimler - Benz company on 28 June of the same year . </P> <P> Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf . After training as a gunsmith and working in France , he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859 . After completing various technical activities in France and England , he started working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862 . At the end of 1863 , he was appointed workshop inspector in a machine tool factory in Reutlingen , where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865 . </P> <P> Throughout the 1930s , Mercedes - Benz produced the 770 model , a car that was popular during Germany 's Nazi period . Adolf Hitler was known to have driven these cars during his time in power , with bulletproof windshields . Most of the surviving models have been sold at auctions to private buyers . One of them is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa , Ontario . The pontiff 's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes - Benz . In 1944 , 46,000 forced laborers were used in Daimler - Benz 's factories to bolster Nazi war efforts . The company later paid $12 million in reparations to the laborers ' families . Mercedes - Benz has introduced many technological and safety innovations that later became common in other vehicles . Mercedes - Benz is one of the best - known and established automotive brands in the world . </P> <P> For information relating to the famous three - pointed star , see under the title Daimler - Motoren - Gesellschaft , including the merger into Daimler - Benz . </P> <H2> Subsidiaries and alliances ( edit ) </H2> <P> As part of the Daimler AG company , the Mercedes - Benz Cars division includes Mercedes - Benz and Smart car production . </P> <H3> Mercedes - AMG ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mercedes - AMG became a majority owned division of Mercedes - Benz in 1999 . The company was integrated into DaimlerChrysler in 1999 , and became Mercedes - Benz AMG beginning on 1 January 1999 . </P> <H3> Mercedes - Maybach ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

Also used for electric models and plug - in hybrids . </Li> <Li> `` G '' was originally used for the Gel\u00e4ndewagen off - road vehicle , but is now applied to Mercedes SUVs in general ( G , GLA , GLC , GLE and GLS ) . </Li> <Li> `` K '' was used in the 1930s , indicating a supercharger ( `` Kompressor '' ) equipped engine . Two exceptions : the SSK and CLK , where K indicates `` Kurz '' ( short - wheelbase ) ( though the SSK had a supercharger ) . </Li> <Li> `` L '' indicates `` Leicht '' ( lightweight ) for sporting models , and `` Lang '' ( long - wheelbase ) for sedan models . </Li> <Li> `` R '' indicates `` Rennen '' ( racing ) , used for racing cars ( for example , the 300SLR ) . </Li> <Li> `` S '' Sonderklasse `` Special class '' for flagship models , including the S - Class , and the SL - Class , SLR McLaren and SLS sports cars . </Li> <Li> `` T '' indicates `` Touring '' and an estate ( or station wagon ) body style . </Li> </Ul> <P> Some models in the 1950s also had lower - case letters ( b , c , and d ) to indicate specific trim levels . For other models , the numeric part of the designation does not match the engine displacement . This was done to show the model 's position in the model range independent of displacement or in the price matrix . For these vehicles , the actual displacement in liters is suffixed to the model designation . An exception was the 190 - class with the numeric designation of `` 190 '' as to denote its entry level in the model along with the displacement label on the right side of the boot ( 190E 2.3 for 2.3 - litre 4 - cylinder petrol motor , 190D 2.5 for 2.5 - litre 5 - cylinder diesel motor , and so forth ) . Some older models ( such as the SS and SSK ) did not have a number as part of the designation at all . </P> <P> For the 1994 model year , Mercedes - Benz revised the naming system . Models were divided into `` classes '' denoted by an arrangement of up to three letters ( see `` Current model range '' above ) , followed by a three - digit ( or two - digit for AMG models , with the number approximately equal to the displacement in litres multiplied by 10 ) number related to the engine displacement as before . Variants of the same model such as an estate version or a vehicle with a diesel engine are no longer given a separate letter . The SLR and SLS supercars do not carry a numerical designation . </P> <P> Today , many numerical designations no longer reflect the engine 's actual displacement , but more of the relative performance and marketing position . Despite its engine displacement in two litres , the powerplant in the A45 AMG produces 355 brake horsepower so the designation is higher as to indicate the greater performance . Another example is the E250 CGI having greater performance than the E200 CGI due to the different engine tuning even though both have 1.8 - litre engines . From the marketing perspective , E200 seems more `` upscale '' than E180 . Recent AMG models use the `` 63 '' designation ( in honor of the 1960s 6.3 - litre M100 engine ) despite being equipped with either a 6.2 - litre ( M156 ) , a 5.5 - litre ( M157 ) or even a 4.0 - litre engine . </P> <P> Some models carry further designations indicating special features : </P> <Ul> <Li> `` 4MATIC '' indicates the vehicle is equipped with all - wheel - drive . </Li> <Li> `` BlueTEC '' indicates a diesel engine with selective catalytic reduction exhaust aftertreatment . </Li> <Li> `` BlueEFFICIENCY '' indicates special fuel economy features ( direct injection , start - stop system , aerodynamic modifications , etc . ) </Li> <Li> `` CGI '' ( Charged Gasoline Injection ) indicates direct gasoline injection . </Li> <Li> `` CDI '' ( Common - rail Direct Injection ) indicates a common - rail diesel engine . </Li> <Li> `` Hybrid '' indicates a petrol - or diesel - electric hybrid . </Li> <Li> `` NGT '' indicates a natural gas - fueled engine . </Li> <Li> `` Kompressor '' indicates a supercharged engine . </Li> <Li> `` Turbo '' indicates a turbocharged engine , only used on A - , B - , E - and GLK - Class models . </Li> <Li> `` AMG Line '' indicates the interior or engine , depending which car , has been fitted with the luxuries of their AMG sports cars </Li> </Ul> <P> Model designation badges can be removed at the request of the customer . </P> 2015 and beyond ( edit ) <P> Rationalisation of the model nomenclature was announced in November 2014 for future models . The changes consolidate many confusing nomenclature and their placements in the model range such as CL - Class is now called the S - Class Coup\u00e9 . The naming structure is divided into four categories : core , off - road vehicle / SUV , 4 - door coup\u00e9 , and roadster . AMG GT , and V - Class are unaffected by the change . In October 2016 , Mercedes unveiled the X-Class ; a pickup truck built on the Nissan Navara . At the 2016 Paris Motor Show , the company announced the EQ , a family of upcoming battery electric vehicles based on a modular platform , expected to represent up to 25 % of its global sales by 2025 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Core </Th> <Th> Off - Road Vehicles / SUV </Th> <Th> 4 - Door Coup\u00e9 </Th> <Th> Roadster </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> GLA </Td> <Td> CLA </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> GLC </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> SLC </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> GLE </Td> <Td> CLS </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> GLS </Td> <Td> SL </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> N / A </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> N / A </Td> <Td> N / A </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Note : The CLA is positioned between the A - and B - Class models , while the CLS sits between the E - and S - Classes . </P> <P> In addition to the revised nomenclature , Mercedes - Benz has new nomenclature for the drive systems . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Current </Th> <Th> New </Th> <Th> Example </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Natural Gas Drive </Td> <Td> c for `` compressed natural gas '' </Td> <Td> B 200 c </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> BlueTec <P> CDI </P> </Td> <Td> d for `` diesel '' </Td> <Td> E 350 d <P> GLA 200 d </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> PLUG - IN HYBRID <P> Electric Drive </P> </Td> <Td> e for `` electric '' </Td> <Td> S 500 e <P> B 250 e </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Fuel Cell </Td> <Td> f for `` fuel cell '' </Td> <Td> B 200 f </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> HYBRID <P> BlueTEC HYBRID </P> </Td> <Td> h for `` hybrid '' </Td> <Td> S 400 h <P> E 300 h </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4MATIC </Td> <Td> 4MATIC </Td> <Td> E 400 4MATIC </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The revised A45 AMG for 2016 model year on has shifted the model designation to the right side while AMG is on the left side . This trend commenced with Mercedes - Maybach with MAYBACH on the left and S500 / S600 on the right . </P> <H3> Environmental record ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mercedes - Benz has developed multi concept cars with alternative propulsion , such as hybrid - electric , fully electric , and fuel - cell powertrains . At the 2007 Frankfurt motor show , Mercedes - Benz showed seven hybrid models , including the F700 concept car , powered by a hybrid - electric drivetrain featuring the DiesOtto engine . In 2009 , Mercedes - Benz displayed three BlueZERO concepts at the North American International Auto Show . Each car features a different powertrain - battery - electric , fuel - cell electric , and gasoline - electric hybrid . In the same year , Mercedes also showed the Vision S500 PHEV concept with a 19 miles ( 31 km ) all - electric range and CO emissions of 74 grams / km in the New European Driving Cycle . </P> <P> Since 2002 , Mercedes - Benz has developed the F - Cell fuel cell vehicle . The current version , based on the B - Class , has a 250 - mile range and is available for lease , with volume production scheduled to begin in 2014 . Mercedes has also announced the SLS AMG E-Cell , a fully electric version of the SLS sports car , with deliveries expected in 2013 . The Mercedes - Benz S400 BlueHYBRID was launched in 2009 , and is the first production automotive hybrid in the world to use a lithium - ion battery . In mid-2010 , production commenced on the Vito E-Cell all - electric van . Mercedes expects 100 vehicles to be produced by the end of 2010 and a further 2000 by the end of 2011 . </P> <P> In 2008 , Mercedes - Benz announced that it would have a demonstration fleet of small electric cars in two to three years . Mercedes - Benz and Smart are preparing for the widespread uptake of electric vehicles ( EVs ) in the UK by beginning the installation of recharging points across their dealer networks . So far 20 Elektrobay recharging units , produced in the UK by Brighton - based Elektromotive , have been installed at seven locations as part of a pilot project , and further expansion of the initiative is planned later in 2010 . </P> <P> In the United States , Mercedes - Benz was assessed a record US $30.66 million fine for their decision to not meet the federal corporate average fuel economy standard in 2009 . Certain Mercedes - Benz cars , including the S550 and all AMG models sold in the United States , also face an additional gas guzzler tax . However , newer AMG models fitted with the M157 engine will not be subject to the gas - guzzler tax , due to improved fuel economy , and newer models powered by the M276 and M278 engines will have better fuel economy . In 2008 , Mercedes also had the worst CO average of all major European manufacturers , ranking 14th out of 14 manufacturers . Mercedes was also the worst manufacturer in 2007 and 2006 in terms of average CO levels , with 181 g and 188 g of CO emitted per km , respectively . </P> <P> In May 2017 , Mercedes partnered with Vivint Solar to develop a solar - energy home storage battery . </P> <P> In February 2018 , it was announced that Mercedes cabin air filters earned the Asthma and Allergy Friendly Certification . </P> <H3> Bicycles ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mercedes - Benz Accessories GmbH introduced three new bicycles in 2005 , and the range has developed to include the patent pending Foldingbike in 2007 .

The six factories will be established across 3 continents . </P> Mercedes - Benz EQC <P> The brand has also planned to launch its electric EQ brand with the EQC SUV being set for production in the year 2019 . In September 2018 , Mercedes unveiled the EQC , its first fully electric car , at an event in Stockholm . </P> <P> 2022 will be the year in which Daimler has said that the company will have invested $11 billion to ensure that every Mercedes - Benz has a fully electric or hybrid version available on the market . </P> <P> While releasing details of the project , Markus Sch\u00e4fer said , </P> <P> `` Our electric vehicles will be built in six plants on three continents . We address every market segment : from the smart fortwo seater , to the large SUV . The battery is the key component of e-mobility . As batteries are the heart of our electric vehicles we put a great emphasis on building them in our own factories . With our global battery network we are in an excellent position : As we are close to our vehicle plants we can ensure the optimal supply of production . In case of a short - term high demand in another part of the world our battery factories are also well prepared for export . The electric initiative of Mercedes - Benz Cars is right on track . Our global production network is ready for e-mobility . We are electrifying the future . '' </P> <H2> Motorsport ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Mercedes - Benz in motorsport A DMG Mercedes Simplex 1906 in the Deutsches Museum <P> The two companies which were merged to form the Mercedes - Benz brand in 1926 had both already enjoyed success in the new sport of motor racing throughout their separate histories . A single Benz competed in the world 's first motor race , the 1894 Paris -- Rouen , where \u00c9mile Roger finished 14th in 10 hours 1 minute . Throughout its long history , the company has been involved in a range of motorsport activities , including sports car racing and rallying . On several occasions Mercedes - Benz has withdrawn completely from motorsport for a significant period , notably in the late 1930s , and after the 1955 Le Mans disaster , where a Mercedes - Benz 300 SLR rammed another car ( An Austin - Healey ) , took off into the stands , and killed more than 80 spectators . Stirling Moss and co-driver Denis Jenkinson made history by winning the 1955 Mille Miglia road race in Italy during a record - breaking drive with an average speed of almost 98 mph in a Mercedes - Benz 300 SLR . </P> <P> Although there was some activity in the intervening years , it was not until 1987 that Mercedes - Benz returned to front line competition , returning to Le Mans , Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft ( DTM ) , and Formula One with Sauber . The 1990s saw Mercedes - Benz purchase British engine builder Ilmor ( now Mercedes - Benz High Performance Engines ) , and campaign IndyCars under the USAC / CART rules , eventually winning the 1994 Indianapolis 500 and 1994 CART IndyCar World Series Championship with Al Unser , Jr. at the wheel . The 1990s also saw the return of Mercedes - Benz to GT racing , and the Mercedes - Benz CLK GTR , both of which took the company to new heights by dominating the FIA 's GT1 class . </P> <P> Mercedes - Benz is currently active in four motorsport categories , Formula Three , DTM , Formula One and GT3 . </P> <H3> Formula One ( edit ) </H3> Both Mercedes - AMG Formula One cars at the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix . Main article : Mercedes - Benz in Formula One <P> Mercedes - Benz took part in the world championship in 1954 and 1955 , but despite being successful with two championship titles for Juan - Manuel Fangio , the company left the sport after just two seasons . Fangio is considered by many to be the best F1 driver in history . </P> <P> Mercedes - Benz returned as an engine supplier in the 1990s and part - owned Team McLaren for some years , to which it has supplied engines engineered by Ilmor since 1995 . This partnership brought success , including drivers championships for Mika H\u00e4kkinen in 1998 and 1999 , and for Lewis Hamilton in 2008 , as well as a constructors championship in 1998 . The collaboration with McLaren had been extended into the production of road - going cars such as the Mercedes - Benz SLR McLaren . </P> <P> In 2007 , McLaren - Mercedes was fined a record US $100 million for stealing confidential Ferrari technical data . </P> <P> In 2009 , Ross Brawn 's newly conceived Formula One team , Brawn GP used Mercedes engines to help win the constructor 's championship , and Jenson Button to become champion in the F1 drivers ' championship . At the end of the season , Mercedes - Benz sold its 40 % stake in McLaren to the McLaren Group and bought 70 % of the Brawn GP team jointly with an Abu Dhabi - based investment consortium . Brawn GP was renamed Mercedes GP for the 2010 season and is , from this season on , a works team for Mercedes - Benz . As of 2017 , the company currently provides engines to Williams Martini Racing and Sahara Force India F1 Team . </P> <P> In 2014 , Mercedes clinched its first F1 Constructor 's title with drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg with 3 races to go , after dominating much of the season . Mercedes repeated its dominance in 2015 in similar fashion , losing only 3 races out of 19 once again . Mercedes yet again dominated in 2016 , losing only 2 races out of 21 . In 2017 , Mercedes secured a 4th title . In these four years of dominance , Lewis Hamilton won the F1 drivers ' championship in 2014 , 2015 , and 2017 while Nico Rosberg won in 2016 . </P> <H2> Logo history ( edit ) </H2> <P> In June 1909 , Daimler - Motoren - Gesellschaft ( DMG ) registered both a three - pointed and a four - pointed star as trademarks , but only the three - pointed star was used .

All earlier cars were `` horseless carriages '' , which had high centres of gravity and various engine / drive - train configurations </Li> <Li> The first passenger road car to have brakes on all four wheels ( 1924 ) </Li> <Li> In 1936 , the Mercedes - Benz 260 D was the first diesel - powered passenger car . </Li> <Li> Mercedes - Benz were the first to offer direct fuel injection on the Mercedes - Benz 300SL Gullwing </Li> <Li> The `` safety cage '' or `` safety cell '' construction with front and rear crumple zones was first developed by Mercedes - Benz in 1951 . This is considered by many as the most important innovation in automobile construction from a safety standpoint </Li> <Li> In 1959 , Mercedes - Benz patented a device that prevents drive wheels from spinning by intervening at the engine , transmission , or brakes . In 1987 , Mercedes - Benz applied its patent by introducing a traction control system that worked under both braking and acceleration </Li> <Li> an Anti-Lock Brake system ( ABS ) was first offered on the W116 450SEL 6.9 . They became standard on the W126 S - Class starting production in 1979 and first sold in most markets in 1980 . </Li> <Li> Airbags were first introduced in the European market , beginning with model year 1981 S - Class . </Li> <Li> Mercedes - Benz was the first to introduce pre-tensioners to seat belts on the 1981 S - Class . In the event of a crash , a pre-tensioner will tighten the belt instantaneously , removing any ' slack ' in the belt , which prevents the occupant from jerking forward in a crash </Li> <Li> In September 2003 , Mercedes - Benz introduced the world 's first seven - speed automatic transmission called ' 7G - Tronic ' </Li> <Li> Electronic Stability Programme ( ESP ) , brake assist , and many other types of safety equipment were all developed , tested , and implemented into passenger cars -- first -- by Mercedes - Benz . Mercedes - Benz has not made a large fuss about its innovations , and has even licensed them for use by competitors -- in the name of improving automobile and passenger safety . As a result , crumple zones and anti-lock brakes ( ABS ) are now standard on all modern vehicles . </Li> </Ul> Mercedes M156 engine <Ul> <Li> The ( W211 ) E320 CDI which has a variable geometry turbocharger ( VGT ) 3.0 - litre V6 common rail diesel engine ( producing 224 hp or 167 kW ) , set three world endurance records . It covered 100,000 miles ( 160,000 km ) in a record time , with an average speed of 224.823 km / h ( 139.70 mph ) . Three identical cars did the endurance run ( one set above record ) and the other two cars set world records for time taken to cover 100,000 kilometres ( 62,137 mi ) and 50,000 miles ( 80,000 km ) respectively . After all three cars had completed the run , their combined distance was 300,000 miles ( 480,000 km ) ( all records were FIA approved ) . </Li> <Li> Mercedes - Benz pioneered a system called Pre-Safe to detect an imminent crash -- and prepares the car 's safety systems to respond optimally . It also calculates the optimal braking force required to avoid an accident in emergency situations , and makes it immediately available for when the driver depresses the brake pedal . Occupants are also prepared by tightening the seat belt , closing the sunroof and windows , and moving the seats into the optimal position . </Li> <Li> At 181 horsepower per litre , the M133 engine installed in Mercedes - Benz A45 AMG is the most powerful series production four - cylinder turbocharged motor ( as of June 2013 ) and has one of the highest power density for a passenger vehicle . </Li> </Ul> <P> Half a century of vehicle safety innovation helped win Mercedes - Benz the Safety Award at the 2007 What Car ? Awards . </P> <H3> Robot cars ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Driverless car <P> In the 1980s , Mercedes built the world 's first robot car , together with the team of Professor Ernst Dickmanns at Bundeswehr University Munich . Encouraged in part by Dickmanns ' success , in 1987 the European Union 's EUREKA programme initiated the Prometheus Project on autonomous vehicles , funded to the tune of nearly \u20ac 800 million . In 1995 Dickmanns ' re-engineered autonomous S - Class Mercedes took a long trip from Munich in Bavaria to Copenhagen in Denmark , and back . On highways , the robot achieved speeds exceeding 175 km / h ( 109 mph ) ( permissible in some areas of the German Autobahn ) . </P> <P> In October 2015 , the company introduced the Vision Tokyo , a five - seat self - driving electric van powered by a hybrid hydrogen fuel - cell system . The super-sleek van is touted as `` a chill - out zone in the midst of megacity traffic mayhem . '' </P> <H2> Tuners ( edit ) </H2> <P> Several companies have become car tuners ( or modifiers ) of Mercedes Benz , in order to increase performance and / or luxury to a given model . AMG is Mercedes - Benz 's in - house performance - tuning division , specialising in high - performance versions of most Mercedes - Benz cars . AMG engines are all hand - built , and each completed engine receives a tag with the signature of the engineer who built it . AMG has been wholly owned by Mercedes - Benz since 1999 . The 2009 SLS AMG , a revival of the 300SL Gullwing , is the first car to be entirely developed by AMG . </P> <P> There are numerous independent tuners , including Brabus , Carlsson , Kleemann and Renntech . </P> <H2> Sponsorships ( edit ) </H2> Mercedes - Benz sponsors the German national football team . <P> In football ( soccer ) , Mercedes - Benz sponsors the Germany national team . Mercedes - Benz sponsors Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart and provides the naming rights for their stadium , the Mercedes - Benz Arena . The company also holds the naming rights to the Mercedes - Benz Superdome , an American football stadium in New Orleans , Louisiana , United States .

Built of travertine , tuff , and brick - faced concrete , it is the largest amphitheatre ever built . The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum . Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 , and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian ( 81 -- 96 ) . These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty , and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name ( Flavius ) . </P> <P> The Colosseum could hold , it is estimated , between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators , having an average audience of some 65,000 ; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles ( for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities ) , animal hunts , executions , re-enactments of famous battles , and dramas based on Classical mythology . The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era . It was later reused for such purposes as housing , workshops , quarters for a religious order , a fortress , a quarry , and a Christian shrine . </P> <P> Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone - robbers , the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World . It is one of Rome 's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church , as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit `` Way of the Cross '' procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum . </P> <P> The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five - cent euro coin . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Name </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Construction , inauguration , and Roman renovations </Li> <Li> 2.2 Medieval </Li> <Li> 2.3 Modern </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Physical description <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Exterior </Li> <Li> 3.2 Interior seating </Li> <Li> 3.3 Arena and hypogeum </Li> <Li> 3.4 Supporting buildings </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Use <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Today <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Restoration </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Significance in Christianity </Li> <Li> 6 Flora </Li> <Li> 7 Works modeled on , or inspired by , the Colosseum </Li> <Li> 8 Popular culture references </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Notes </Li> <Li> 10.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Name </H2> The Colosseum <P> The Colosseum 's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium , often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre . The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty , following the reign of Nero . This name is still used in modern English , but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum . In antiquity , Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum ( with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar ) , but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum ; Vespasian and Titus , builders of the Colosseum , also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli ( modern Pozzuoli ) . </P> <P> The name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby This statue was later remodeled by Nero 's successors into the likeness of Helios ( Sol ) or Apollo , the sun god , by adding the appropriate solar crown . Nero 's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors . Despite its pagan links , the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers . It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome . </P> <P> In the 8th century , a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted : Quamdiu stat Colis\u00e6us , stat et Roma ; quando cadet colis\u00e6us , cadet et Roma ; quando cadet Roma , cadet et mundus ( `` as long as the Colossus stands , so shall Rome ; when the Colossus falls , Rome shall fall ; when Rome falls , so falls the world '' ) . This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus ( as in , for instance , Byron 's poem Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ) . However , at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote , the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre . </P> <P> The Colossus did eventually fall , possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze . By the year 1000 the name `` Colosseum '' had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre . The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives , situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma . </P> <P> The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages . In Italy , the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo , and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul ( Romanian ) , le Colis\u00e9e ( French ) , el Coliseo ( Spanish ) and o Coliseu ( Portuguese ) . </P> <H2> History </H2> <H3> Construction , inauguration , and Roman renovations </H3> Colosseum Sestertius of Titus celebrating the inauguration of the Colosseum ( minted 80 AD ) . A map of central Rome during the Roman Empire , with the Colosseum at the upper right corner <P> The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian , Esquiline and Palatine Hills , through which a canalised stream ran . By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited . It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 , following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain . He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site , in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions , gardens and porticoes . The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea . </P> Cross-section from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik ( 1904 ) <P> Although the Colossus was preserved , much of the Domus Aurea was torn down . The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre . Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea . Vespasian 's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero 's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use . In contrast to many other amphitheatres , which were located on the outskirts of a city , the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre ; in effect , placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome . </P> <P> Construction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem . According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site , `` the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general 's share of the booty . '' Along with the spoils , estimated 100,000 Jewish prisoners were brought back to Rome after the war , and many contributed to the massive workforce needed for construction . The slaves undertook manual labor such as working in the quarries at Tivoli where the travertine was quarried , along with lifting and transporting the quarried stones 20 miles from Tivoli to Rome . Along with this free source of unskilled labor , teams of professional Roman builders , engineers , artists , painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum . The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials : wood , limestone , tuff , tiles , cement , and mortar . </P> <P> Construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian in around 70 -- 72 AD ( 73 -- 75 AD according to some sources ) The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian 's death in 79 . The top level was finished by his son , Titus , in 80 , and the inaugural games were held in A.D. 80 or 81 . Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre . Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration . The building was remodelled further under Vespasian 's younger son , the newly designated Emperor Domitian , who constructed the hypogeum , a series of underground tunnels used to house animals and slaves . He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity . </P> <P> In 217 , the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire ( caused by lightning , according to Dio Cassius ) which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre 's interior . It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320 . Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435 . An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III ( reigned 425 -- 455 ) , possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443 ; more work followed in 484 and 508 . The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century . Animal hunts continued until at least 523 , when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes , criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost . </P> <H3> Medieval </H3> Map of medieval Rome depicting the Colosseum <P> The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use during the medieval period . By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater , though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole . The arena was converted into a cemetery . The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops , and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century . Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it , apparently using it as a castle . </P> <P> Severe damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349 , causing the outer south side , lying on a less stable alluvial terrain , to collapse . Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces , churches , hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome . A religious order moved into the northern third of the Colosseum in the mid-14th century and continued to inhabit it until as late as the early 19th century . The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone , which was reused elsewhere , or ( in the case of the marble fa\u00e7ade ) was burned to make quicklime . The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls , leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today . </P> <H3> Modern </H3> The Colosseum in a 1757 engraving by Giovanni Battista Piranesi 1747 view by Giovanni Paolo Panini , emphasizing the semi-rural environs of the Colosseum at the time <P> During the 16th and 17th century , Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum . Pope Sixtus V ( 1585 -- 1590 ) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome 's prostitutes , though this proposal fell through with his premature death . In 1671 Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights ; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned . </P> Allied troops consult a guidebook outside the Colosseum after liberation in 1944 <P> In 1749 , Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred . He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross , declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there ( see Significance in Christianity ) . However , there is no historical evidence to support Benedict 's claim , nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the 16th century suggested this might be the case ; the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition , other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been . </P> Interior of the Colosseum , Rome ( 1832 ) by Thomas Cole , showing the Stations of the Cross around the arena and the extensive vegetation <P> Later popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects , removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further . The fa\u00e7ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827 , and the interior was repaired in 1831 , 1846 and in the 1930s . The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810 -- 1814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s . </P> <P> The Colosseum is today one of Rome 's most popular tourist attractions , receiving millions of visitors annually . The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000 , at a cost of 40 billion Italian lire ( $19.3 m / \u20ac 20.6 m at 2000 prices ) . </P> <P> In recent years the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment , which was abolished in Italy in 1948 . Several anti -- death penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000 . Since that time , as a gesture against the death penalty , the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum 's night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released , or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty . Most recently , the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November 2012 following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April 2012 . </P> <P> Because of the ruined state of the interior , it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events ; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating . However , much larger concerts have been held just outside , using the Colosseum as a backdrop . Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles ( May 2002 ) , Paul McCartney ( May 2003 ) , Elton John ( September 2005 ) , and Billy Joel ( July 2006 ) . </P> The Colosseum today as a background to the busy metropolis <H2> Physical description </H2> <H3> Exterior </H3> Original fa\u00e7ade of the Colosseum <P> Unlike earlier Greek theatres that were built into hillsides , the Colosseum is an entirely free - standing structure . It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two Roman theatres back to back . It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters ( 615 ft / 640 Roman feet ) long , and 156 meters ( 510 ft / 528 Roman feet ) wide , with a base area of 24,000 square metres ( 6 acres ) . The height of the outer wall is 48 meters ( 157 ft / 165 Roman feet ) . The perimeter originally measured 545 meters ( 1,788 ft / 1,835 Roman feet ) . The central arena is an oval 87 m ( 287 ft ) long and 55 m ( 180 ft ) wide , surrounded by a wall 5 m ( 15 ft ) high , above which rose tiers of seating . </P> <P> The outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic metres ( 3,531,467 cubic feet ) of travertine stone which were set without mortar ; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps . However , it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries , with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes . The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing ; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions , having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall . The remainder of the present - day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall . </P> The exterior of the Colosseum , showing the partially intact outer wall ( left ) and the mostly intact inner wall ( center and right ) <P> The surviving part of the outer wall 's monumental fa\u00e7ade comprises three stories of superimposed arcades surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic , both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals . The arcades are framed by half - columns of the Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders , while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters . Each of the arches in the second - and third - floor arcades framed statues , probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology . </P> <P> Two hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic . They originally supported a retractable awning , known as the velarium , that kept the sun and rain off spectators . This consisted of a canvas - covered , net - like structure made of ropes , with a hole in the center . It covered two - thirds of the arena , and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience . Sailors , specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby Castra Misenatium , were used to work the velarium . </P> Entrance LII of the Colosseum , with Roman numerals still visible <P> The Colosseum 's huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly . Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadiums to deal with the same problem . The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level , 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators . Each entrance and exit was numbered , as was each staircase . The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides , whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite . All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs , of which fragments survive . Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall , but entrances XXIII ( 23 ) to LIV ( 54 ) survive . </P> <P> Spectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards , which directed them to the appropriate section and row . They accessed their seats via vomitoria ( singular vomitorium ) , passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind . These quickly dispersed people into their seats and , upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation , could permit their exit within only a few minutes . The name vomitoria derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge , from which English derives the word vomit . </P> <H3> Interior seating </H3> The raked areas that once held seating <P> According to the Codex - Calendar of 354 , the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people , although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000 . They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society . Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins , providing the best views of the arena . Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or podium for the senatorial class , who were allowed to bring their own chairs . The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework , presumably reserving areas for their use . </P> Diagram of the levels of seating <P> The tier above the senators , known as the maenianum primum , was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights ( equites ) . The next level up , the maenianum secundum , was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens ( plebeians ) and was divided into two sections . The lower part ( the immum ) was for wealthy citizens , while the upper part ( the summum ) was for poor citizens . Specific sectors were provided for other social groups : for instance , boys with their tutors , soldiers on leave , foreign dignitaries , scribes , heralds , priests and so on . Stone ( and later marble ) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles , who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them . Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups . </P> <P> Another level , the maenianum secundum in legneis , was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian . This comprised a gallery for the common poor , slaves and women . It would have been either standing room only , or would have had very steep wooden benches . Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum , notably gravediggers , actors and former gladiators . </P> <P> Each tier was divided into sections ( maeniana ) by curved passages and low walls ( praecinctiones or baltei ) , and were subdivided into cunei , or wedges , by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria . Each row ( gradus ) of seats was numbered , permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus , cuneus , and number . </P> <H3> Arena and hypogeum </H3> The Colosseum arena , showing the hypogeum now filled with walls . The walls were added early in the Colosseum 's existence when it was decided it would no longer be flooded and used for naval battles . Latin inscription in the Colosseum <P> The arena itself was 83 meters by 48 meters ( 272 ft by 157 ft / 280 by 163 Roman feet ) . It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand ( the Latin word for sand is harena or arena ) , covering an elaborate underground structure called the hypogeum ( literally meaning `` underground '' ) . The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian . Little now remains of the original arena floor , but the hypogeum is still clearly visible . It consisted of a two - level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began . Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath ; larger hinged platforms , called hegmata , provided access for elephants and the like . It was restructured on numerous occasions ; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen . </P> Detail of the hypogeum <P> The hypogeum was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum . Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables , with the gladiators ' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels . Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds . </P> <P> Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the hypogeum . Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props , as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release . There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts , it was possible to flood the arena rapidly , presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct . However , the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian 's behest put an end to the practise of flooding , and thus also to naval battles , early in the Colosseum 's existence . </P> <H3> Supporting buildings </H3> The Colosseum -- a view from the Oppian Hill <P> The Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area . In addition to the amphitheatre itself , many other buildings nearby were linked to the games . Immediately to the east is the remains of the Ludus Magnus , a training school for gladiators . This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage , to allow easy access for the gladiators . The Ludus Magnus had its own miniature training arena , which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators . Other training schools were in the same area , including the Ludus Matutinus ( Morning School ) , where fighters of animals were trained , plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools . </P> <P> Also nearby were the Armamentarium , comprising an armory to store weapons ; the Summum Choragium , where machinery was stored ; the Sanitarium , which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators ; and the Spoliarium , where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of . </P> <P> Around the perimeter of the Colosseum , at a distance of 18 m ( 59 ft ) from the perimeter , was a series of tall stone posts , with five remaining on the eastern side . Various explanations have been advanced for their presence ; they may have been a religious boundary , or an outer boundary for ticket checks , or an anchor for the velarium or awning . </P> <P> Right next to the Colosseum is also the Arch of Constantine . </P> <H2> Use </H2> Pollice Verso ( Thumbs Down ) by Jean - L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me , 1872 <P> The Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events . The shows , called munera , were always given by private individuals rather than the state . They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige , and were immensely popular with the population . Another popular type of show was the animal hunt , or venatio . This utilized a great variety of wild beasts , mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East , and included creatures such as rhinoceros , hippopotamuses , elephants , giraffes , aurochs , wisents , Barbary lions , panthers , leopards , bears , Caspian tigers , crocodiles and ostriches . Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings . Such events were occasionally on a huge scale ; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days . During lunch intervals , executions ad bestias would be staged . Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena , naked and unarmed , to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces . Other performances would also take place by acrobats and magicians , typically during the intervals . </P> <P> During the early days of the Colosseum , ancient writers recorded that the building was used for naumachiae ( more properly known as navalia proelia ) or simulated sea battles . Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls . There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean ( Corfiot ) Greeks and the Corinthians . This has been the subject of some debate among historians ; although providing the water would not have been a problem , it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed , nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around . It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong , or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis ( which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum ) . </P> <P> Sylvae or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena . Painters , technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena 's floor , and animals would then be introduced . Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population , or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology . They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story -- played by a condemned person -- was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways , such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death . </P> <H3> Today </H3> A panorama of the interior of the Colosseum in 2016 <P> The Colosseum today is now a major tourist attraction in Rome with thousands of tourists each year entering to view the interior arena . There is now a museum dedicated to Eros located in the upper floor of the outer wall of the building . Part of the arena floor has been re-floored . Beneath the Colosseum , a network of subterranean passageways once used to transport wild animals and gladiators to the arena opened to the public in summer 2010 . </P> <P> The Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries . For instance , Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross ( which calls for more meditation ) at the Colosseum on Good Fridays . </P> Restoration <P> In 2011 Diego Della Valle , head of the shoe firm Tod 's , entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a \u20ac 25 million restoration of the Colosseum . Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011 , taking up to two and a half years . Due to the controversial nature of using a public -- private partnership to fund the restoration , work was delayed and began in 2013 . The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum 's history . The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum 's arcaded fa\u00e7ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground - level arches . Taking three years , the final product of this work was unveiled July 1 , 2016 , when the Italian minister of culture , Dario Franceschini , also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018 . These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for `` cultural events of the highest level . '' The project also plans to create a services center and to restore the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum. . New to tours of the restored marvel beginning November 1 , 2017 , the top two levels have been opened for guided visits . The fourth level held the marketplace , and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens , the plebians , gathered and watched the show , bringing picnics for the day - long event . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2013 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2013 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2012 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2013 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2013 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2013 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2013 </P> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2014 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Colosseum 2018 </P> </Li> </Ul> <H2> Significance in Christianity </H2> The Christian Martyrs ' Last Prayer , by Jean - L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me ( 1883 ) View of the interior of the Colosseum , by C.W. Eckersberg ( 1815 ) <P> The Colosseum is generally regarded by Christians as a site of the martyrdom of large numbers of believers during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire , as evidenced by Church history and tradition . On the other hand , other scholars believe that the majority of martyrdoms may have occurred at other venues within the city of Rome , rather than at the Colosseum , citing a lack of still - intact physical evidence or historical records. These scholars assert that `` some Christians were executed as common criminals in the Colosseum -- their crime being refusal to reverence the Roman gods '' , but most Christian martyrs of the early Church were executed for their faith at the Circus Maximus . According to Iren\u00e6us ( died about 202 ) , Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions in Rome around 107 A.D and although Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum , tradition ascribes it to that place . </P> <P> In the Middle Ages , the Colosseum was not regarded as a monument , and was used as what some modern sources label a `` quarry , '' which is to say that stones from the Colosseum were taken for the building of other sacred sites . This fact is used to support the idea that , at a time when sites associated with martyrs were highly venerated the Colosseum was not being treated as a sacred site . It was not included in the itineraries compiled for the use of pilgrims nor in works such as the 12th century Mirabilia Urbis Romae ( `` Marvels of the City of Rome '' ) , which claims the Circus Flaminius -- but not the Colosseum -- as the site of martyrdoms . Part of the structure was inhabited by a Christian religious order , but it is not known whether this was for any particular religious reason . </P> <P> Pope Pius V ( 1566 -- 1572 ) is said to have recommended that pilgrims gather sand from the arena of the Colosseum to serve as a relic , on the grounds that it was impregnated with the blood of martyrs , although some of his contemporaries did not share his conviction . A century later Fioravante Martinelli listed the Colosseum at the head of a list of places sacred to the martyrs in his 1653 book Roma ex ethnica sacra . Martinelli 's book evidently had an effect on public opinion ; in response to Cardinal Altieri 's proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring , Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration . The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum 's external arcades and declare it a sanctuary . </P> Cross dedicated to the Christian martyrs , placed in 2000 by Pope John Paul II . <P> At the insistence of St. Leonard of Port Maurice , Pope Benedict XIV ( 1740 -- 1758 ) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena , which remained until February 1874 . Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum , living on alms , before he died in 1783 . Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum , and it still retains its Christian connection today . A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum , with a plaque , stating : </P> <P> The amphitheater , one consecrated to triumphs , entertainments , and the impious worship of pagan gods , is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions . </P> <P> Other Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater . </P> <H2> Flora </H2> Plants on the inner walls of the Colosseum <P> The Colosseum has a wide and well - documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643 . Since then , 684 species have been identified there . The peak was in 1855 ( 420 species ) . Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation , because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry , but much of it has returned . 242 species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli , 200 remain . </P> <P> The variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries . Additionally , bird migration , flower blooming , and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city , as well as deliberate transport of species , are also contributing causes . Another reason often given is their seeds being unwittingly transported either on the fur or in the feces of animals brought there from all corners of the empire . </P> <H2> Works modeled on , or inspired by , the Colosseum </H2> <Ul> <Li> The Kongresshalle , or `` Congress Hall '' , ( 1935 , unfinished ) at the Nazi Party Rally grounds , Nuremberg , Germany </Li> <Li> The Summer Olympic Games medal from 1928 to 2000 , designed by Giuseppe Cassioli , features a depiction of the Colosseum .

It was designed by Moshe Safdie . </Li> <Li> The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum entrance was inspired by the Colosseum . </Li> <Li> The Palazzo della Civilta Italiana was very closely modelled on the Colosseum . It was built for Mussolini for the Universal Exhibition of 1942 but the exhibition never happened due to the outbreak of World War II .

The Colosseum is of great importance to the entire Assassin 's Creed series as a whole : first , it was an entrance site to a Lair of Romulus , second , the Lair beneath the Colosseum led directly to the Temple of Juno Moneta which housed the Apple of Eden , third , it was used in a Passion Play depicting Jesus Christ 's crucifixion where an assassination attempt was unfoiled by the protagonist Ezio Auditore da Firenze , fourth , in the 21st century , Desmond Miles freeran through the maze in the Colosseum in order to find the Temple of Juno Moneta below the Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli and the Apple kept in it by Ezio in 1506 and fifth , it has a glyph at the top . In addition , the Colosseum is elliptical ( oval - shaped ) in reality , but it was made circular for Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood , since devising shadows for different sides of the buildings would have `` driven game designers nuts '' . </P> <P> The iconic status of the Colosseum has led it to be featured in numerous films , such as Roman Holiday , Demetrius and the Gladiators , 20 Million Miles to Earth , Way of the Dragon , Gladiator ( in which it was re-created via CGI ) , Megiddo : The Omega Code 2 , The Core , The Lizzie McGuire Movie , Jumper , and the animated movie Madagascar 3 : Europe 's Most Wanted . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Roman amphitheatre </Li> <Li> List of Roman amphitheatres </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Portals Access related topics </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Rome portal </Li> <Li> Architecture portal </Li> <Li> History portal </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References </H2> <H3> Notes </H3> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Building the Colosseum '' . roman-colosseum.info . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hopkins , p. 2 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` BBC 's History of the Colosseum p. 2 '' .

Built of travertine , tuff , and brick - faced concrete , it is the largest amphitheatre ever built . The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum . Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 , and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian ( 81 -- 96 ) . These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty , and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name ( Flavius ) .",

( January 2013 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Garc\u00eda Padilla formed a cabinet composed of former aides and members of the private sector to form the 16th Cabinet of Puerto Rico . He holds office in parallel with the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico , the 25th Senate of Puerto Rico , and the 29th House of Representatives of Puerto Rico . His primary challenge will be taking a government with a large indebtness and high deficit . His first executive orders were proclaimed on 3 January 2013 , one day after being sworn in . One of them activated the Puerto Rico National Guard to monitor Puerto Rico 's coasts and ports in order to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of illegal goods into the island , while another established that the Puerto Rico Chief of Staff must be consulted before making any appointments to empty seats , issuing contracts or amending existing contracts . The third executive order was proclaimed to control spending in agencies with credit cards , phones , escorts , official cars , overseas travel , and cell phones and personal digital assistants . </P> <H3> Domestic policies </H3> <P> On 30 June 2013 , Garc\u00eda Padilla signed the Redistribution and Tax Charge Adjustment Act of 2013 ( Act No. 40 of 2013 ) reducing the portion of the Puerto Rico Sales and Use Tax that municipalities charge from a 1.5 % to 1.0 % -- effectively lowering the total sales tax from 7.0 % to 6.5 % . However , this change has not yet been reflected , and the sales tax rate of 7.0 % remains . The Act also expanded the use tax to include more services , including business - to - business sales and services like consulting . Under his administration , a new tax of 4 cents per liter was imposed on gasoline . </P> <P> As part of his economic policies , Garc\u00eda Padilla launched an austerity programme , raising taxes by 1.1 % of the gross national product ( GNP ) and making public employees ' pension schemes less generous . These measures are expected to trim the government deficit from $2.2 billion to $800 million . This , according to The Economist , has made 62 % of Puerto Ricans disapprove of Garc\u00eda Padilla . </P> <P> On June 28 , 2014 , Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla signed into law the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act , which sought to allow corporations owned by the Commonwealth , such as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority , the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority , and the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority to declare bankruptcy . However , in February 2015 , U.S. District Judge Francisco Besosa found the Act was void because it was preempted by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . In July 2015 , that ruling was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit , with Judge Juan R. Torruella concurring only in the judgment . The following June , in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax - Free Trust ( 2016 ) , that ruling was additionally affirmed by a U.S. Supreme Court in a vote of 5 - 2 , with Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissenting . </P> <P> Facing the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis , in June 2015 , Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla announced the Commonwealth was in a `` death spiral '' and `` the debt is not payable . '' </P> <P> On June 30 , 2016 , President Barack Obama signed the PROMESA into law , which empowered him to appoint a seven - member Financial Oversight and Management Board that has ultimate control over the Commonwealth 's budget . </P> <H3> Foreign policies </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section is missing information about Garc\u00eda Padilla 's efforts to promote the Puerto Rico nation branding and his administration 's efforts to strengthen trade relations with Panama .

( August 2013 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In June 2013 , Garc\u00eda Padilla traveled to Spain where he met with representatives of the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry of Spain to showcase Puerto Rico as an attractive investment destination . </P> <P> In July 2013 , Garc\u00eda Padilla 's administration established a trade agreement between Colombia and Puerto Rico whereby Colombia will import medicine from Puerto Rico and provide knowledge transfer in several industries . Puerto Rico on the other hand will co-manufacture products together with Colombia , so that Colombia can benefit from Puerto Rico 's lack of tariffs when exporting to the United States . </P> <H2> Public image and perception </H2> <P> On 4 August 2013 , protesters marched in Old San Juan to express their discontent with new taxes imposed by his administration and the way the government has been handling its finances . </P> <P> On 6 November 2013 , El Nuevo D\u00eda released poll results published a year after his election that indicated that 57 % of poll participants rated Garc\u00eda - Padilla 's administration with a `` D '' or an `` F '' grade and 62 % disapproved of his performance as governor . </P> <P> He has also been accused of nepotism , because of his having five relatives working in the government , three of them as political appointees . Most of the criticism was focused on the appointment of his cousin , Ricardo Colon Padilla , as director of the commonwealth 's Medicaid program , as Colon been previously convicted of providing the FBI and IRS with false testimony during an investigation . </P> <P> Garcia Padilla has been criticized by some Puerto Ricans for his poor command of the English language , marked by stammering , poor vocabulary , a strong accent , and difficulty in understanding the language . He has tried to shake off criticism of his language skills by appealing to populism , stating that he is proud of his rural origins , and that his English reflects said origin , and that he also `` speaks better English than a mainlander speaks Spanish . '' </P> <P> On 14 December 2015 after weeks of speculation and due to opposition from his own party , Garc\u00eda Padilla announced he would n't seek re-election . </P> <H2> Personal life </H2> <P> Garc\u00eda Padilla has been married to Wilma Pastrana , a CPA , since 7 April 2001 . They have three children : Ana , Juan Pablo , and Diego . Among his older brothers , Antonio served as President of the University of Puerto Rico and Juan Carlos serves as mayor of Coamo . Another of his brothers , Luis Gerardo , was a government employee with the Puerto Rico Telephone Company . </P> <H2> Ancestry </H2> `` The template below ( Ahnentafel top ) is being considered for deletion .

Goku and Vegeta notice that Frieza is progressively losing stamina and that his power level is dropping , though Frieza himself fails to notice this . Vegeta urges Goku to quickly finish Frieza off before he has a chance to recover , or he will step up and do so himself . After Goku and Frieza exchange some sarcastic banter , they power up again and continue their fight . Frieza still has the upper hand , but Goku realizes he only needs to stall Frieza long enough for his weakness to reappear . After a fully powered Frieza unleashes a barrage of attacks , he quickly becomes tired and starts running out of breath , with his attacks no longer hurting Goku . Frieza finally realizes his weakness ; a lack of endurance , as his Golden form exhausts more energy than he can produce . Goku explains this is because Frieza rushed to Earth immediately after achieving the Golden form without giving himself enough time to master it . Frieza agonizes over his failed chance at revenge in combat , but mouths a few inaudible words to Sorbet for assistance .

Meanwhile , Goku heads to a local farmer 's market to sell his produce and get Chi - Chi off his back about making money . On the way home , he is ambushed by some robbers . Goku defeats them , but he is injured in the process . Deciding that he has grown rusty , Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis . They head to the Capsule Corporation building , where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta 's second child . Goten remains behind to train with Trunks . Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth . Goku heads to Beerus ' planet alone . While training with Whis , Goku remembers Grand Zen\u014d 's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament . Heedless of Beerus and Whis ' warnings , Goku uses Grand Zen\u014d 's button to head to his realm and convinces Present Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to hold the tournament . When he returns to Beerus ' planet , Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Grand Zen\u014d naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse . Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again . Goku , Beerus , and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais , where the Grand Minister arrives . He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the `` Tournament of Power '' ( \u529b \u306e \u5927\u4f1a , Chikara no Taikai ) . 78 `` The Gods of Every Universe in Shock ? !

It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence . Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty . Goku suggests asking Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to ignore it , but Whis advises against this . Whis tells Goku that Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zen\u014d 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters . Goku sets off to recruit teammates . After Vegeta refuses , Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu , who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7 . Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan . Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic . Back at Grand Zen\u014d 's and Future Grand Zen\u014d 's palace , all the gods from all 12 universes gather . The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match . He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament . In the first round , Majin Buu is to fight Basil ( \u30d0\u30b8\u30eb , Bajiru ) , a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9 . 79 `` Universe 9 's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7 's Majin Buu ! !

Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 . However , Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil . This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory . As the Universe 9 team laments Basil 's loss , Basil 's second oldest brother Lavender ( \u30e9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0 , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent , which Bergamo gives him permission to do , he can win his match . Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender . 80 `` Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit ! Son Gohan 's Fight ! ! '' / `` Nemutta t\u014dshi o yobisamase ! Son Gohan no tatakai ! !

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared . With the announcement concluded , the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo ( \u30d9\u30eb\u30ac\u30e2 , Berugamo ) , Basil 's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine . 81 5 `` Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku !

Bergamo pleads with Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased . Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle . Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner . Suddenly , a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo ( \u30c8\u30c3\u30dd ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle . Goku , who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo , agrees to fight Toppo . 82 6 `` Never Forgive Son Goku ! Toppo the Warrior of Justice Intrudes ! ! '' / `` Son Gok\u016b yurusumaji !

Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku 's shoulder . Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows , but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug . He begins squeezing the life out of Goku , which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape . Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha . Just as the two power up even more , the Grand Minister puts an end to the fight . As Toppo leaves , he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren ( \u30b8\u30ec\u30f3 ) . The Grand Minister begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power . In the Sacred World of the Kais , Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku 's constant relaxed and negligent attitude , which Whis breaks up . The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy . 83 7 `` Form the Universe 7 Representing Team ! Who are the Strongest Ten ? !

They discuss who should be on the team . Goku immediately suggests Monaka , but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and can not participate . Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta , Piccolo , Krillin , Master Roshi , No. 18 , and No. 17 , which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine . Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience . They proceed to ask Vegeta , who has been thinking of a name for his second child . Vegeta refuses to participate . He says he will not fight , while Bulma is pregnant . Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight . Everyone celebrates the baby 's birth . Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother . As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta , he develops an attachment to her . Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot . However , Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla 's name . Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin 's house . 84 8 `` Son Goku the Recruiter Invites Krillin and No. 18 '' / `` Sukautoman Son Gok\u016b -- Kuririn to 18 - g\u014d o izanau '' ( \u30b9\u30ab\u30a6\u30c8 \u30de\u30f3 \u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a \u30af\u30ea\u30ea\u30f3 \u3068 18 \u53f7 \u3092 \u8a98\u3046 ) April 2 , 2017 TBA Goku and Gohan arrive at Krillin 's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power .

She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them , but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward , which convinces her to participate . Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast . After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat , Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea . Goku is excited by Krillin 's new power . He challenges him to a sparring match as well . They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan , where Krillin 's strategies make up for the gap in power , forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan . Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form , and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash . As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin , No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku 's Kamehameha , just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion . She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku can not expect to fight one - on - one all the time .

However , Piccolo spots Shantza and blasts him off the ring , which eliminates him and destroys the illusions . Universe 4 's last fighter , Damon ( \u30c0\u30e2\u30f3 , Damon ) , is also assumed to be invisible since no one can see him . Piccolo is able to sense Damon 's attacks , but he proves unable to hit Damon , who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him . No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug - like creature rather than an invisible person , which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him . To solve this problem , Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air , which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts . No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him . With all of their fighters eliminated , Universe 4 is promptly erased . 120 44 `` The Perfect Survival Tactic ! Universe 3 's Menacing Assassin ! ! '' / `` Kanpeki na Seizon Senryaku !

This causes Jiren to fall , but Jiren is able to push off the falling debris and jumps back onto the fighting stage . Angered by his near - elimination , Jiren finally shows his real power and easily overwhelms Goku with a volley of punches . Goku and Vegeta both get back up and power up to Super Saiyan Blue .

Dyspo reveals his own ultimate technique , the Super Maximum Light Speed Mode , which increases his power and speed even further , and overwhelms Frieza . Gohan and No. 17 realize that Frieza is in danger of being knocked off the fighting stage , so No. 17 distracts Toppo , while Gohan goes to Frieza 's aid . Gohan and Frieza take on Dyspo as a team , but they have little success . Gohan develops a strategy that has Frieza use his energy to form a cage around Dyspo , which prevents him from using his high - speed attacks and allows Gohan to gain the upper hand .

In the wake of the explosion , Toppo appears to have been defeated . However , he gets back up and powers up , using the same type of energy as a God of Destruction . Belmod explains that Toppo is a candidate to be Universe 11 's next God of Destruction , which is why he can wield the same kind of power . Toppo unleashes his new power , which damages the fighting stage and breaks a large portion of it . No. 17 and Frieza attack Toppo repeatedly , but his power is now far superior to theirs .

Vegeta and Toppo both use their ultimate attacks : Toppo unleashes his Energy of Destruction , while Vegeta uses the Final Explosion technique that he used against Majin Buu . Vegeta 's attack overwhelms Toppo 's attack , blasts Toppo out of the fighting stage , and eliminates him from the tournament . This also causes even more damage to the fighting stage . Due to Vegeta being much stronger than the last time he used the Final Explosion technique , he survives the blast , but his energy is almost completely drained .

However , his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship , and he now focuses solely on increasing his own strength . No. 17 admires Jiren 's human qualities , but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe 's team for his own ends . Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17 , Goku , and Vegeta .

It is a hybrid of Capsicum chinense and Capsicum frutescens and is closely related to the Naga Morich of Bangladesh . </P> <P> In 2007 , Guinness World Records certified that the ghost pepper was the world 's hottest chili pepper , 400 times hotter than Tabasco sauce . The ghost chili is rated at more than 1 million Scoville heat units ( SHUs ) . However , the ghost chili was shortly superseded by the Infinity chili in 2011 , followed by the Naga Viper , the Trinidad moruga scorpion in 2012 and the Carolina Reaper on August 7 , 2013 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 2 Scoville rating </Li> <Li> 3 Characteristics </Li> <Li> 4 Uses <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Defense Project </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Dorset Naga </Li> <Li> 6 Gallery </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Etymology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The chili is named differently in different regions . In Assam , it is widely known as bh\u00fbt z\u00f4l\u00f4kia ( \u09ad\u09cb\u099f \u099c\u09b2\u0995\u09c0\u09af\u09bc\u09be ) or bih z\u00f4l\u00f4kiya . In some parts of Assam , this chili is called n\u00f4ga z\u00f4l\u00f4kia ( \u09a8\u0997\u09be \u099c\u09b2\u0995\u09c0\u09af\u09bc\u09be ) , believed to be named after the ferocious Naga warriors inhabiting the plains and hills of Nagaland . Further complicating matters , a 2009 paper coined the English term `` Naga king chili '' which refers to the chili 's large pod size . This is probably because the chili has long been colloquially known as Raja mircha or Raja mirchi in Nagaland . It also stated that the most common Indian ( Assamese ) usage is bh\u00fbt z\u00f4l\u00f4kiya ( \u09ad\u09cb\u099f \u099c\u09b2\u0995\u09c0\u09af\u09bc\u09be ) and gives the alternate common name as bih z\u00f4l\u00f4kia ( \u09ac\u09bf\u09b9 \u099c\u09b2\u0995\u09c0\u09af\u09bc\u09be , bih means `` poison '' in Assamese , denoting the plant 's heat ) . The Assamese word z\u00f4l\u00f4kia simply means the Capsicum pepper . Other usages on the subcontinent are saga jlokia , Indian mystery chili , and Indian rough chili ( after the chili 's rough skin ) . It has also been called the Tezpur chili after the Assamese city of Tezpur . In Manipur , the chili is called umorok or oo - morok ( oo = `` tree '' , morok = `` chili '' ) . The Kukis called it `` Malcha - Phoh '' meaning `` the most pungent chilli '' . </P> <H2> Scoville rating ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2000 , India 's Defence Research Laboratory ( DRL ) reported a Scoville rating of 855,000 SHUs , and in 2004 a rating of 1,041,427 SHUs was made using HPLC analysis . For comparison , Tabasco red pepper sauce rates at 5000 -- 10,000 , and pure capsaicin ( the chemical responsible for the pungency of pepper plants ) rates at 16,000,000 SHUs . </P> <P> In 2005 , New Mexico State University 's Chile Pepper Institute in Las Cruces , New Mexico , found Bhut jolokia grown from seed in southern New Mexico to have a Scoville rating of 1,001,304 SHUs by HPLC . </P> 30 - day - old Bhut jolokia plant <P> Climate has a considerable effect on the heat of these peppers . A 2005 study showed that Bhut jolokia peppers grown in Tezpur ( Assam ) are more than twice as hot as those grown in Gwalior 's more arid climate . Elsewhere in India , scientists at Manipur University measured its average Scoville rating by HPLC at only 329,100 SHUs . </P> <P> Unlike most peppers , Bhut jolokia produces capsaicin in vesicles found in both the placenta around the seeds and throughout the fruit , rather than just the placenta . </P> <H2> Characteristics ( edit ) </H2> <P> Ripe peppers measure 60 to 85 mm ( 2.4 to 3.3 in ) long and 25 to 30 mm ( 1.0 to 1.2 in ) wide with a red , yellow , orange , or chocolate color . The unselected strain of Bhut jolokia from India is an extremely variable plant , with a wide range in fruit sizes and fruit production per plant , and offers a huge potential for developing much better strains through selection in the future . Bhut jolokia pods are unique among peppers , with their characteristic shape , and very thin skin . However , the red fruit variety has two different fruit types , the rough , dented fruit and the smooth fruit . The images on this page show examples of both the rough and the smooth fruit . The rough fruit plants are taller , with more fragile branches , and the smooth fruit plants yields more fruit , and is a more compact plant with sturdier branches . It takes about 7 -- 12 days to germinate at 32 -- 38 \u00b0 C . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Plant height </Th> <Td> 45 -- 120 cm ( 17 -- 47 inches ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Stem color </Th> <Td> Green </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Leaf color </Th> <Td> Green </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Leaf length </Th> <Td> 10.65 -- 14.25 cm </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Leaf width </Th> <Td> 5.4 -- 7.5 cm </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Pedicels per axil </Th> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Corolla color </Th> <Td> Yellow green </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Anther color </Th> <Td> Pale blue </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Annular constriction </Th> <Td> Present below calyx </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fruit color at maturity </Th> <Td> Red is the most common , with orange , yellow and chocolate as rarer varieties </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Fruit shape </Th> <Td> Subconical to conical </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fruit length </Th> <Td> 5.95 -- 8.54 cm </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fruit width at shoulder </Th> <Td> 2.5 -- 2.95 cm </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fruit weight </Th> <Td> 6.95 -- 8.97 g </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fruit surface </Th> <Td> Rough , uneven or smooth </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Seed color </Th> <Td> Light tan </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1000 seed weight </Th> <Td> 4.1 -- 5.2 g </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Seeds per fruit </Th> <Td> 19 -- 35 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Hypocotyl color </Th> <Td> Green </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Cotyledonous leaf shape </Th> <Td> Deltoid </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Uses ( edit ) </H2> The Bhut jolokia ( \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 - \u099c\u09b2\u0995\u09c0\u09af\u09bc\u09be ) <P> Bhut jolokia is used as a food and a spice , as well as a remedy to summer heat . It is used in both fresh and dried forms , to `` heat up '' curries , pickles and chutneys . It is popularly used in combination with pork or dried or fermented fish . In northeastern India , the peppers are smeared on fences or incorporated in smoke bombs as a safety precaution to keep wild elephants at a distance . The pepper 's intense heat makes it a fixture in competitive chili pepper eating . </P> <H3> Defense project ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Chili grenade <P> In 2009 , scientists at India 's Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) announced plans to use the peppers in hand grenades , as a nonlethal way to flush out terrorists from their hideouts and to control rioters . It would also be developed into pepper spray as a self - defence and antirape product . The DRDO said bhut jolokia - based aerosol sprays could be used as a `` safety device '' , and `` civil variants '' of chili grenades could be used to control and disperse mobs . </P> <P> Chili grenades made from Bhut jolokia were successfully used by the Indian Army in August 2015 to flush out terrorist Sajjad Ahmed , who was hiding in a cave . </P> <P> In August 2016 , home minister of India , Rajnath Singh announced that Indian security forces will replace controversial pellet guns with pepper grenades . </P> <H2> Dorset Naga ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Naga Morich <P> The Dorset Naga is a substrain of the original Naga , selected from the Bangladeshi varieties of the chili , Naga morich . </P> <P> Annually , since 2005 , the heat level of Dorset Naga has been tested , taking samples from different sites , various seasons , and states of maturity . The heat level has ranged from 661,451 SHUs for green fruit in 2007 , up to 1,032,310 SHUs for ripe fruit harvested in 2009 . </P> <P> High as the results were , the BBC 's Gardeners ' World television programme recorded a much higher heat level for Dorset Naga . As part of the 2006 programming , the BBC gardening team ran a trial looking at several chili varieties , including Dorset Naga . Heat levels were tested by Warwick HRI , and the Dorset Naga came in at 1,598,227 SHUs , one of the hottest heat levels ever recorded for a chili . </P> <H2> Gallery ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> <P> Bhut jolokia leaf about 10 days old plant </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Bhut jolokia leaf about 30 days old plant </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Bhut jolokia plant 40 days grown in coco peat </P> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> <P> Peach Bhut jolokia </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Yellow Bhut jolokia </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Chocolate Bhut jolokia </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Purple Bhut jolokia </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Red Bhut jolokia </P> </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of Capsicum cultivars </Li> <Li> Nagabon </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Shaline L.

It is presented annually by the Academy to a feature - length film produced outside the United States with primarily non-English dialogue . The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process , reviewing all films submitted . </P> <P> For the 87th Academy Awards , held on 22 February 2015 , a submitted motion picture must be released theatrically in its respective country between 1 October 2013 and 30 September 2014 . Submission of a film does not automatically qualify it for the competition ; AMPAS has the final word on eligibility , and has disqualified submissions in the past . One film was accepted from each country , with a deadline of 1 October 2014 ; the Academy published a list of eligible films eight days later . </P> <P> Eighty - three countries submitted films , with four countries entering for the first time . Mauritania submitted Timbuktu , directed by Abderrahmane Sissako ; Panama entered the documentary Invasion , directed by Abner Benaim ; Kosovo submitted Three Windows and a Hanging , directed by Isa Qosja ; and Malta entered Simshar , directed by Rebecca Cremona . In May 2014 , Nigeria announced that AMPAS had approved the first - ever Nigerian Oscar selection committee and they would make their first Oscar submission ; however , they did not submit a film by the deadline . </P> <P> The Phase I committee , consisting of several hundred Los Angeles - based Academy members , viewed the original submissions between mid-October and 15 December 2014 . The group 's top six choices , augmented by three selections by the Academy 's Foreign Language Film Award Executive Committee , constitute the shortlist . Seventy - six films were originally considered , and the nine finalists were shortlisted in mid-December . </P> <P> The list was narrowed down to five nominees by invited committees in New York , Los Angeles and ( for the first time ) London , who viewed three films a day from 9 to 11 January 2015 before casting their ballots . The list of nominees was announced on 15 January 2015 at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Los Angeles . They were Argentina 's Wild Tales , directed by Dami\u00e1n Szifron ; Estonia 's Tangerines , directed by Zaza Urushadze ; Mauritania 's Timbuktu , directed by Abderrahmane Sissako ; Poland 's Ida , directed by Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski , and Russia 's Leviathan , directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev . For the first time , the director 's name would be engraved on the Oscar statuette in addition to the country name . The winner was Poland 's Ida , directed by Pawlikowski . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Submissions </Li> <Li> 2 See also </Li> <Li> 3 Notes </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li>

Written and produced by Motown CEO Berry Gordy , Jr. , `` Do You Love Me ? '' was the Contours ' only Top 40 single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States . Notably , the record achieved this feat twice , once in 1962 and again in 1988 . A main point of the song is to name the Mashed Potato , The Twist , and a variation of the title `` I like it like that '' , as `` You like it like this '' , and many other fad dances of the 1960s . </P> <P> The song is noted for the spoken recitation heard in the introduction which goes : `` You broke my heart / ' Cause I could n't dance / You did n't even want me around / And now I 'm back / To let you know / I can really shake ' em down '' </P> <P> The song is noted for its false ending at 2 : 26 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Original release </Li> <Li> 2 Covers </Li> <Li> 3 Revival </Li> <Li> 4 Remix </Li> <Li> 5 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 6 Personnel : The Contours </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Original release ( edit ) </H2> <P> Berry Gordy wrote `` Do You Love Me '' with the intention that The Temptations , who had no Top 40 hits to their name yet , would record it . However , when Gordy wanted to locate the group and record the song , they were nowhere to be found ( the Temptations had not been made aware of Gordy 's intentions , and had departed Motown 's Hitsville USA recording studio for a local Detroit gospel music showcase ) . </P> <P> After spending some time looking for the Temptations , Gordy ran into the Contours ( Billy Gordon , Hubert Johnson , Billy Hoggs , Joe Billingslea , Sylvester Potts , and guitarist Hugh Davis ) in the hallway . Wanting to record and release `` Do You Love Me '' as soon as possible , Gordy decided to let them record his `` sure - fire hit '' instead of the Temptations . The Contours , who were in danger of being dropped from the label after their first two singles ( `` Whole Lotta ' Woman '' and `` The Stretch '' ) failed to chart , were so elated at Gordy 's offer that they immediately began hugging and thanking him . </P> <P> `` Do You Love Me , '' the fifth release on Gordy Records , became a notably successful dance record , built around Gordon 's screaming vocals . Selling over a million copies , `` Do You Love Me '' peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks starting on October 20 , 1962 , and was a number - one hit on the Billboard R&B Singles chart . An album featuring the single , Do You Love Me ( Now That I Can Dance ) , was also released . None of the Contours ' future singles lived up to the success of `` Do You Love Me '' , although its success won the group a headlining position on Motown 's very first Motor Town Revue tour . </P> <H2> Covers ( edit ) </H2> <P> Like many American R&B songs of the 1960s , `` Do You Love Me ? '' was covered by a number of British Invasion groups . Three British groups who recorded their own versions of the song were Brian Poole and the Tremeloes ( who hit number one with it in the UK Singles Chart after learning it from Liverpool 's Faron 's Flamingos ) , the Dave Clark Five and The Hollies on their 1964 album Stay with the Hollies . The song has also been covered by The Sonics , The Kingsmen , Paul Revere & the Raiders and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers . In 1965 , Bob Marley and the Wailers recorded the song `` Playboy , '' which incorporates `` Do You Love Me '' 's chorus . The song was covered by the English glam rock band Mud for their album mud rock ( 1974 ) . The song was one of the highlights of The Blues Brothers ' live set . Bruce Springsteen frequently ended his shows in the mid-1980s with the song , as part of a medley with `` Twist and Shout '' . Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1988 album The Chipmunks and The Chipettes : Born to Rock . Indie band Steadman has a well known cover of the song , played in the style of the Dave Clark Five . Andy Fraser covered the song in the style of the 1980s back in 1984 . Westlife performed a live version for their The Greatest Hits Tour in 2003 . German girl group Preluders covered the song for their cover album Prelude to History in 2004 . In 1992 David Hasselhoff famously sang the song in an episode of Baywatch . In November 2013 , The Overtones covered the song for their album Saturday Night at the Movies . In February 2015 , Chester See & Andy Lange uploaded a cover of `` Do You Love Me '' to See 's YouTube channel . In 2017 Colt Prattes , Nicole Scherzinger & J. Quinton Johnson covered the song for ABC Dirty Dancing movie remake . </P> <H2> Revival ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` Do You Love Me '' is featured prominently in the 1987 film Dirty Dancing , reviving the record 's popularity . Re-issued as a single from the More Dirty Dancing soundtrack album , `` Do You Love Me '' became a hit for the second time , peaking at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1988 . The Contours , by then composed of Joe Billingslea and three new members , joined Ronnie Spector and Bill Medley , among others , on a ' Dirty Dancing Tour ' resulting from the success of the film . The song also appeared in the episode `` The End '' in season 5 of TV series Supernatural . The song was also made into a music video in the Tiny Toon Adventures episode `` Toon TV '' . David Hasselhoff performed it on Baywatch in the 1992 episode `` The Reunion '' . He later performed `` Do You Love Me '' with Kids Incorporated in 1984 in the Season 1 episode `` School 's For Fools '' . Kids Incorporated covered `` Do You Love Me '' in 1991 during the Season 7 episode `` Teen Spotlight '' . </P> <H2> Remix ( edit ) </H2> <P> With the re-release of the single in 1988 , Motown also released a 12 '' maxi - single ( Motown 68009 ) with an extended dance remix , running 6 : 26 . The remix was also included in the late 1988 Motown CD reissue of the album Do You Love Me ( Now That I Can Dance ) on Motown 37463 - 5415 - 2 . This remix only appears on the CD and Cassette tape issues , as the Vinyl LP of the same release has the original 2 : 54 minute hit version . </P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H2> <P> This song was in the soundtrack for Dirty Dancing ( 1987 ) , Sleepwalkers ( 1992 ) and Getting Even with Dad ( 1994 ) . It was featured in the 1979 movie The Wanderers . The song also had an appearance in Beethoven 's 2nd , where George Newton ( Charles Grodin ) dances to the song while preparing his breakfast . </P> <H2> Personnel : The Contours ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Lead vocal by Billy Gordon and Billy Hoggs </Li> <Li> Background vocals by Hubert Johnson , Billy Hoggs , Joe Billingslea , and Sylvester Potts </Li> <Li> Guitar by Huey Davis </Li> <Li> Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Roberts , David ( 2006 ) .

Cold , condescending , judgmental and uptight , Angela is often negative and frowns upon all frivolous activity in the office , and openly expressed her disapproval of office receptionist Pam Beesly 's flirtation with coworker Jim Halpert . She also frowns upon any sort of superfluousness or inappropriateness in general . Like Dwight , Angela has little sense of humour and almost never smiles or expresses happiness , except when she is talking about her cats or is expressing derisive contempt for her co-workers . Angela is attracted to shows of power , extremely secretive with her other emotions , and vengeful when upset . </P> <H2> Biography ( edit ) </H2> <P> In addition to heading the accounting department , Angela is also the former head of the Party Planning Committee and the office 's Safety Officer . She is a constant source of complaints to Human Resources , although she retracts those lodged against Dwight Schrute at the onset of their secret romance . Angela lives with several cats , adores posters of infants posed as adults , and is a vegetarian and a singer . When she makes a mistake , Angela 's first response is usually to shift the blame to someone else , along with an insult . Angela 's extreme religious homophobia makes her dislike Will & Grace ( although she says it 's because it 's `` terribly loud '' ) , except for the scenes with Harry Connick , Jr . ( `` He 's so talented '' ) . She is a former child beauty pageant contestant , and says that she enjoys being judged . She tends to list colors that she finds `` whorish '' , including orange and green , that always seem to correspond to the color of clothes being worn by either Phyllis or Meredith . Angela bottles up her emotions to the point that , on occasion , she has private , emotional outbursts over relatively trivial matters . She also seems to be something of a conservative ( albeit hypocritical ) Christian . She states that the two books she would bring with her to read if stranded on a deserted island are the Bible and The Purpose Driven Life . Further , she would bring The Da Vinci Code , but only so she could burn it . She despises the mystery novel genre because , in her words , `` I hate being titillated . '' However , in a deleted scene from `` Dream Team '' , she says her new boss Charles Miner is mysterious and wants to flip to `` his last page '' . In a deleted scene from Season 3 , Angela glowingly compares Dwight to Fox News commentator Sean Hannity . She says in Prince Family Paper that her ideal of male beauty is Boris Becker . </P> <P> She was mainly seen as a minor character in the first two seasons but since starting her relationship with Dwight her character has been explored numerous times and has been so further since their break - up in Fun Run . Throughout season 3 and carrying on into season 4 , Angela essentially became the second lead female of the show , after Pam Beesly . </P> <P> Angela has a sister to whom she was very close but has not spoken in sixteen years over a disagreement she does not even remember , a situation that she regards with a great deal of pride . She appears unable to apologize , as further detailed in `` Product Recall '' when she can not bring herself to say sorry on behalf of the company ( saying instead `` our official position is apologetic '' ) , and in `` The Return '' when she uses a wordy , third - person monologue as a way of apologizing to Oscar for being homophobic . She did , however , say she was sorry to Kevin for being `` mean '' twice in `` The Accountants . '' She has a second sister who she is also very close with , who is her maid of honor at her wedding during the series finale . </P> <P> It was revealed in `` The Return '' and confirmed in `` Happy Hour '' that her middle name is Noelle . </P> <P> Angela drives a light brown first generation Ford Focus sedan , as seen in `` The Dundies '' and `` The Client '' . In the season six episode `` Niagara '' , she is seen to drive a second generation Saturn S - Series ( which Oscar 's lover Gill used to drive ) . </P> <P> Angela 's petite size is a running gag of the show . Angela claims to weigh eighty - two pounds and wears a child 's size ten ( `` Women 's Appreciation '' ) . In addition , because she finds the clothes at Gap Kids to sometimes be too `` flashy '' , she occasionally shops at the American Girl store , buying items meant for `` large colonial dolls '' . Michael has twice made fun of her stature , nicknaming her `` Booster Seat '' in reference to small children having to sit on one in restaurants . He later `` roasted '' her during `` Stress Relief '' by saying he could n't see her when she was hiding behind a grain of rice . Her 5'1 '' height is sharply contrasted to 6'1 '' Dwight . </P> <P> Angela ruled ( in seasons 1 - 4 ) the Party Planning Committee ( PPC ) with an iron fist . Usually when a committee member suggests an idea , Angela immediately shoots it down with a mean comment or sharp rebuke . The PPC normally consists of Angela , Pam , Phyllis , and Meredith , although Meredith was naturally not present when the committee planned her surprise birthday party . Karen became a regular member of the PPC when she was transferred to Scranton , but was expelled by Angela for her `` unsuitable '' ideas during `` A Benihana Christmas '' . Ryan joined the committee to help plan the Christmas Party , and Oscar joined it to help plan his own `` Welcome Back '' party ( `` The Return '' ) . Angela was particularly hard on Phyllis during `` Launch Party '' and was left with a huge burden when Phyllis got fed up and quit the PPC . </P> <P> It is implied in the webisode series , Blackmail , that she has or had a clandestine sexual relationship with her church pastor when Creed hands out envelopes containing incriminating information on several of his peers and Meredith opens her envelope and asks `` Who 's Pastor Davis ? '' prompting Creed to switch the envelopes between Angela and Meredith . After reading the note , Angela appears to be heavily embarrassed . </P> <P> In The Chump , Angela reveals that her four cats are named `` Ember , Milky Way , Diane , and Lumpy '' . </P> <P> In the season eight premiere Angela is married to Robert and pregnant . She is pregnant with her first child but she has a step son with Robert . Angela wanted to name her son `` Philip '' after her cat , but Pam ( who is pregnant with her 2nd child ) wanted the name `` Philip '' after her grandfather . Angela tried browbeating Pamela into giving up the name rights -- in a deleted scene , she said Jim would n't take care of the name because `` he ca n't even get a decent haircut ! '' -- and after Pam rebuffed her , threatened to take the name first by having a C - section done ( even though she would only be six months ' pregnant at the time ) . In the end , both children are named Philip . </P> <H2> Relationships ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Dwight ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dwight is the only person that Angela likes in the office . It is shown in `` E-mail Surveillance '' that Dwight and Angela have begun a romantic relationship . Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him , she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship , and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight 's passion for her . Their relationship is seemingly summarized in `` A.A.R.M. '' : when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses `` how loudly I love you '' , Angela meekly whispers `` It 's too loud . '' In `` Traveling Salesman '' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate , so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them . After Dwight is told he would be fired if he did n't tell Michael why he went to New York , he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela . Angela later tells Michael what happened , but still does n't reveal their relationship . In `` Fun Run '' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles , who is feeling sick , but Dwight kills it , which causes Angela to break up with him . After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4 , she stops dating Dwight , but at the end of `` Goodbye Toby '' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight . Dwight ends their affair in `` The Duel '' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy . In `` The Delivery '' Dwight , who wants to improve his sales by having a child , asks Angela to have his baby . The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together , but in `` Happy Hour '' , Dwight hooks up with Pam 's friend Isabel , and tells Angela he does n't want her to have his baby . In `` The Chump '' the two call in a lawyer , and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times . She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton . After she gives birth ( Jury Duty ) , Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he , not Robert , is the father . Angela and Dwight go through a paternity test and in `` New Guys '' it is revealed that Dwight is not Philip 's father . In `` A.A.R.M. '' Dwight proposes to Angela , and she accepts . She then tells Dwight that she lied before and Dwight is Philip 's father . Angela tells him that she wanted to make sure that Dwight wanted to marry her for no other reason than for love . </P> <H3> Pam ( edit ) </H3> <P> Angela generally disapproves of Pam because of `` all the people '' she has dated in the office . She even calls her the `` office mattress '' in `` Dunder Mifflin Infinity '' . Pam originally did n't invite Angela to her wedding with Roy because she did n't want anyone who 'd called her a `` hussy '' to be at her wedding , and assumes it was Angela who filed a complaint with Toby over her at - work wedding planning ( it turned out that it was Jim who did so ) . Pam is the first to find out about Dwight and Angela 's relationship in `` E-mail Surveillance '' . In `` The Injury '' , when Dwight gets a concussion , Pam notices Angela is upset and comforts her by hinting that Dwight is okay . Their relationship does warm up a little in `` Traveling Salesman '' in which they share some conversation while getting coffee ; in a deleted scene , Angela offers Pam her dominant male cat Ash , but after Pam apologetically declines , Angela 's chilly behavior returns . In `` Niagara '' , Angela 's complaints lead Pam to bluntly say Angela does not have to come to the wedding ; while Angela does arrive with everyone else , her main success there is an offer to chaperone Pam on the pre-wedding night , leading Pam to give up on going out and return to her room . In `` Costume Contest '' , Angela uses a dismissive `` blech '' term regarding Pam . Ironically , both Kinsey and Fischer are close friends in real life . </P> <H3> Andy ( edit ) </H3> <P> Angela was in a relationship with Andy throughout Season 4 and carrying on into Season 5 . Initially , she dates him on the rebound after a break - up with her boyfriend of two years ( Dwight ) . Scenes imply however that she was beginning to genuinely like him more and more , such as in `` Did I Stutter '' when Dwight watches the two of them in the break room playing Mad Libs together and laughing . Despite being surprised and shocked by Andy 's sudden proposal in `` Goodbye Toby '' , she accepts , and the two are engaged until it comes to a dissolution in `` The Duel '' when Andy learns she had been having an affair with Dwight . </P> <P> She 's later shown to be in a state of depression , and at times openly regrets dating both men . On `` Secretary 's Day '' in Season 6 , Andy 's new girlfriend Erin finds out about the two 's relationship , and publicly demeans Angela in the conference room . Angela has a brief conversation with Erin shortly afterward , where she expresses her humiliation and reminds Erin that she wants to forget the memories of dating him . Andy has rarely talked to Angela or expressed any opinions about her in subsequent episodes . When he quits his job to pursue his dreams of stardom near the series ' end , Angela ( informed by her own life upheavals ) talks to him about not letting pride ruin his life . While Andy assumes she is talking about how their relationship ended and says that is something he does reflect on sometimes , Angela fights through her lingering disgust that she was ever with him and finally tells him , mutedly but sincerely , that she wishes him good luck . Andy is part of Dwight 's bachelor party and attends the wedding of his old co-workers . </P> <H3> Phyllis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Up until Season 5 , Angela is the head of the Party Planning Committee along with Phyllis as her assistant . Angela is patronizing and bossy towards Phyllis , who admits that Angela is hard to deal with and that the two have a severe disliking towards one another . In `` Goodbye Toby '' , Phyllis catches Angela and Dwight having sex in the back of the office ( thus cheating on her fianc\u00e9 at the time ) and uses this to blackmail Angela and make her do what she wants . In `` New Leads '' , Michael gives Angela Phyllis ' leads , and Angela , in retaliation for all the aggravating tasks she had to endure while under her control , makes her do some accounting work only to shred it later . Phyllis states in `` Conflict Resolution '' that ( even though they constantly butt heads ) , they are close . By the finale , Phyllis and Angela seemed to have resolved their differences . Angela , incapacitated by a foot injury , apologizes for snapping at Phyllis , who then volunteers to carry Angela down the aisle . </P> <H3> Robert Lipton ( edit ) </H3> <P> Angela meets Robert Lipton , who 's with his son , at Dwight 's hay festival . They get along well , and at the end of the day , he asks for her number . It 's later revealed that they 've started dating and also that Robert is a state senator . There are strong hints throughout the rest of the season that he 's gay , which almost everyone eventually notices . Angela remains oblivious however . In the season 7 finale , he proposes to her and they 're officially engaged ( marking her second engagement on the show ) . It was confirmed by Angela Kinsey at the NBC Press Tour that she and Robert will have gotten married over the summer . In the season 8 premiere , it is revealed that Angela and Robert are married and she is pregnant . </P> <H3> Other relationships ( edit ) </H3> <P> Angela tends to be somewhat abrasive towards other office workers , often outright insulting them . In the season 3 premiere , she expresses an open homophobia and dislike for Oscar , who is outed as a homosexual . However , it appears that by `` The Return '' she has decided to overlook her problems with this , helping to plan a party for Oscar 's return from vacation . She treats her other accounting colleague , Kevin , with open disdain , although the two are very occasionally seen to show affection for each other , such as in the episode ' Branch Closing ' , in which they embrace warmly when they learn that the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin is to remain open , or the series 2 episode ' The Injury ' , in which they are seen smiling and joking together in the background . She has a clear disgust and annoyance with her former boss Michael Scott , often barely able to fathom his ridiculous and time - wasting antics ; although she does say she is `` thrilled '' for Michael and Holly 's relationship . In a scene during the extended version of Michael 's last episode , she refuses to mention any qualities Michael had , other than the fact that he worked in the same office as she did for nineteen years . Angela also shows concern for Stanley after he suffers a heart attack , trying to protect him from Michael 's attempts to `` help '' him . She strongly disapproves of office romances , playing a game called `` Pam - Pong '' in which she counts the number of times Jim leaves his desk to talk to Pam ( as mentioned above , Angela referred to Pam as the `` office mattress '' ) . Somewhat mirroring the relationship between Pam and Toby , throughout the first three seasons Angela is shown to have a crush on Pam 's fianc\u00e9e Roy Anderson , with Roy occasionally showing interest in Angela as well , specifically when asked at one time who in the office he would have sex with besides Pam . During the fifth season , Angela developed a one - sided crush on corporate higher - up Charles Miner . She frequently tried and failed to engage in a relationship with him , often butting heads with Kelly for his affection . It 's subtly implied in an online webisode series , `` Blackmail '' , that she has or had a clandestine sexual relationship with her church pastor when Creed hands out envelopes containing incriminating information on several of his peers and Meredith opens her envelope and asks `` Who 's Pastor Davis ? '' prompting Creed to switch the envelopes between Angela and Meredith . After reading the note , Angela appears to be heavily embarrassed . </P> <H2> Character history ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Seasons 1 -- 2 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Angela is established as a strict and stubborn office worker , and she is something of a perfectionist . She appears to be a prime example of an authoritarian personality . She is also in charge of the Party Planning Committee and is often at odds with Phyllis Lapin . When it is noted that red streamers are bad during Meredith Palmer 's party , she blames it on Phyllis , though it seems to be her fault . There are many deleted scenes in which Angela is interviewed , as well as other members of accounting , suggesting that the series was originally intended to take a two - perspective look at the office : one from accounting 's point of view , and one from sales . </P> <P> Angela refuses to accept the `` Tight Ass '' award at the 8th Annual Dundie Awards . When she sees Kelly give Dwight ( her secret love interest ) a small kiss in the episode `` Christmas Party '' , she gets angry and throws Christmas ornaments outside the building . Though she is a constant source of complaints to Human Resources ( she and Oscar Martinez fight over her poster of babies playing instruments , which she got from Toby Flenderson for Christmas ) , she redacts those lodged against Dwight at the onset of their secret romance . It is hinted during `` Drug Testing '' that she does not take birth control , in accordance to her Christian beliefs . This revelation is to the relief of Dwight implying that they are having sex . She has a bobblehead doll made in Dwight 's likeness as a Valentine 's Day gift , and receives a key to his house in return . Angela hints that she has a crush on Pam 's fianc\u00e9 Roy ( Webisodes : The Accountants , `` Someone in the Warehouse '' ) and admits that she would choose Roy over Jim if pressed on the matter ( `` The Secret '' ) . </P> <H3> Seasons 3 -- 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Angela is disgusted at the revelation that Oscar is gay ( `` Gay Witch Hunt '' ) , and does not bother to hide it . Her attitude toward him becomes much more sympathetic after he returns to work following an extended absence ( `` The Return '' ) , and the two appear to have reconciled . She believes Oscar has the capability to cross over to dating women if he so chooses . Evidently , Angela continues to nurture a crush on Roy , complimenting him on his physique and greeting him , in the third - season episode `` Branch Closing '' . In the same episode , she spontaneously hugs Kevin upon discovering their branch will not be closed , the second moment to date , along with Kevin 's cancer scare in the season two episode `` Michael 's Birthday '' , in which she has shown anything but contempt for him . </P> <P> In `` The Convention '' , she secretly follows Dwight to the office supply convention in Philadelphia under the name `` Jane Doe '' and gets a room which Jim accidentally enters , though it does not appear he saw that it was her ( exclaiming `` Dwight got a hooker ! '' ) . Angela would seem to call Dwight `` D '' outside the office , as she ( mistakenly ) does when Jim enters Dwight 's hotel room . She also persuades Dwight to supplant Michael as Regional Manager ( \u00e0 la Lady Macbeth ) , but it does not succeed . She has a good first impression of Andy Bernard when he shows up on his first day with a cat screensaver . When Angela rudely shoots down an idea proposed by Karen Filippelli , the PPC defiantly splits into two groups and two parties . Angela holds the less popular one , to which only Kevin , Phyllis , and Hannah come , while ( Pam ) and Karen lead the more popular one . Eventually the two parties merge back into one and Angela returns a `` missing '' power cord for the karaoke machine . In `` Traveling Salesmen '' , it is suggested that Angela 's middle name is Noelle when she becomes giddy over her blossoming relationship with Dwight ( Kurt ) Schrute and attempts to bond with Pam , a venture that is cut short when the latter declines Angela 's offer of the `` dominant male '' in a recent litter of cats had by her favorite pet , Sprinkles . </P> <P> In `` The Return '' , she is briefly moved to tears while inviting Oscar to join the PPC as an apology for her apparent disapproval of his homosexuality and is visibly saddened by the insensitivity of Michael 's proposal to celebrate Oscar 's `` Mexicanity '' by featuring Mexican lemonade ( Lemo\u00f1ad\u00e9 , with diacriticals added by Ryan , presumably upon Michael 's request ) and bite - sized frozen - dinner Chimichangas , though in both instances she may be displacing her grief over Dwight 's temporary resignation from the company . </P> <P> In deleted scenes from Phyllis ' Wedding , Phyllis seats Angela next to Dennis , a religious vet who shares her passion for cats . The two get along well , but when Dennis asks Angela for her telephone number , Angela tells him she 's already having intimate relations with someone ( Dwight ) . Dennis , visibly both upset and disgusted , apologizes to her before leaving , saying `` Phyllis neglected to mention your promiscuity . '' </P> <P> It is illustrated that Angela has a love of learning , as seen in `` Ben Franklin '' where she is the only female intently listening to the Ben Franklin impersonator , `` Diwali '' where she takes a cautious interest in learning more about Hindu religion and culture ( although she also makes ignorant comments about the religion and Indian food , specifically whining that the naan at the Diwali party is dry ) , and `` The Job '' in which she enthusiastically participates in Dwight 's lecture on soil . </P> <P> Her refusal to allow Dwight to publicize their relationship prevented him from exonerating himself against suspicion of disloyalty and forced his resignation . Dwight returns to Dunder Mifflin after she clears his name while preserving the secrecy of their relationship ( she tells Michael that Dwight bailed her out , but does not correct Michael 's clueless assertion that Dwight helped her `` as a random co-worker '' ) . </P> <P> The relationship between Angela and Dwight is almost of Macbeth proportions as when Dwight was fooled by Michael into believing he was going to be the new regional manager at the branch ( which Angela pushed by Dwight going behind Michael 's back ) , Dwight leaves her in charge of the women . In `` The Job '' , when Dwight is temporarily given Michael 's job as acting regional manager , Dwight immediately informs her and she seems to rekindle the idea of mastering the puppet strings over Dwight , as well as speculating happily that co-worker Kelly Kapoor will be fired . </P> <P> In the episode `` Fun Run '' , Dwight and Angela 's relationship hits a snag when Dwight euthanizes Sprinkles , Angela 's old and sickly pet cat . Dwight thought Sprinkles had died after he 'd expertly administered it with a lethal dose of Benadryl , and so put the cat in the freezer to cover the smell ; however , Angela was horrified to find that Sprinkles had only died when frozen . Angela is especially bothered by this because , `` cat heaven is a beautiful place , but you do n't get there if you 're euthanized '' . In the next episode , `` Dunder Mifflin Infinity '' , Angela breaks up with Dwight because `` every time ( she looks ) into his eyes , ( she sees ) Sprinkles 's cold , lifeless body '' . In `` Launch Party '' , Angela prepares a party for the launch of the company website . On the day of the launch , Dwight attempts to woo her back by competing ( and winning ) against the website to sell more reams of paper than the other , but Angela refuses to consider it . Michael , in a bid for vengeance against a perceived slight by Ryan , orders Angela , with one hour left before the party begins , to implement his over-the - top ideas for decorations and catering . She is unable to do so partly due to not having enough time and partly due to Phyllis taking a stand against her harsher than usual criticism and refusing to help . In the meantime Andy tries to win Angela 's affection ; although initially unsuccessful ( to Dwight 's relief ) , a last - minute performance of `` Take a Chance on Me '' produces a partly suppressed smile from her . In the episode `` Money '' , Angela decides to go out with Andy after he gives her a cat as a present ( actually a stray that Dwight had tried unsuccessfully to give her as a reconciliation gift ) , giving him instructions on taking her to dinner that included `` no seafood places '' . In the following episodes , they have apparently been seeing each other , but it is implied that Angela still harbors feelings for Dwight , as Andy reports in `` Local Ad '' that she cried out `` Oh , D ! '' when he kissed her , and Dwight recognizes this as her nickname for him ( though Andy thinks it means `` Dee '' as in `` An - Dee '' ) . </P> <P> In `` Job Fair '' , Angela and Dwight were the only two left in the office after the remaining members of the team took off early as a result of Michael not being in the office . For the rest of the day , the two share an awkward atmosphere which eventually thaws towards the end of the day . </P> <P> In `` Goodbye , Toby '' , at Toby 's outdoor leaving party , Angela reluctantly accepts Andy 's proposal of marriage , after he asks her in front of everyone , including his own parents . At the very end of the episode , however , Phyllis is taking some of the party supplies back to the office and walks in on Angela mid-intercourse with Dwight . The episode ended on Angela and Dwight 's reaction to Phyllis ' walking in . </P> <H3> Seasons 5 -- 6 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In `` Weight Loss '' , Andy continually pesters Angela with ideas for their wedding . Most of his proposals are outlandish and expensive , and Angela continues to treat him and his ideas with contempt . She pages Dwight , and they meet in the Dunder Mifflin warehouse to have sex . This seems to be a habit , but later in the episode Andy tells Angela he does n't care where they marry so long as they 're together . This moves Angela enough not to cheat on him with Dwight who is left waiting alone on this one occasion but it does n't last , as Andy continues to irritate Angela about his college friends coming to stay with them for three weeks to perform at the wedding . Angela tells Andy they 'll talk about it later and rushes to page and subsequently hook up with Dwight downstairs . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Phyllis has dethroned Angela as head of the Party Planning Committee and does not hesitate to give Angela harsh orders . Angela puts up with Phyllis ' sternness because she does n't want Phyllis to tell Andy she is cheating on him . </P> <P> In `` Crime Aid '' , Dwight , with advice from Phyllis , gives Angela an ultimatum -- him or Andy . Angela looks to Andy , signifying that she chooses him , although Dwight says to Phyllis that `` she ignored the ultimatum . '' Dwight then treats Phyllis coldly but forgives her after he realizes she was just trying to help . </P> <P> In `` Customer Survey '' , Angela finally agrees to Andy 's renting a tent -- as long as it 's set on a site which matches Schrute Farm Bed & Breakfast . Andy books the farm and Dwight gleefully agrees to plan every detail of the wedding , pointedly offering to be available to Angela day or night . Angela understands the double meaning and shows signs of being very turned on by it . </P> <P> In `` Business Trip '' , it is revealed she and Andy have never been intimate . When Andy drunk dials her demanding sex , she is disgusted , even though , in the background , viewers can hear Dwight in her bed . She later demotes Andy back to `` first base '' , which for her is a kiss on the forehead . </P> <P> In `` The Surplus '' , Dwight escorts Angela and Andy to Schrute Farms to plan details of the wedding . In a supposed mock ceremony , Dwight stands in for Andy as a Mennonite , German - speaking minister completes the vows . Angela begins to admit she has made a mistake and seems to reconcile with Dwight , however he announces they have actually married . She is angered at his deception and storms off . At the office , she passionately kisses Andy in front of the staff and leaves to `` take care of a legal matter '' , implying she will have the marriage annulled . </P> <P> In `` Moroccan Christmas '' , Phyllis continues her torment of Angela , going as far to force Angela to discard her personal nativity scene and the Christmas tree as they do n't fit in with the theme . When she learns that she 's eating food served during Ramadan , she immediately spits it out . When Angela finally revolts because she believes Phyllis will never reveal her secret , Phyllis stuns the entire staff by revealing the Dwight - Angela affair . Angela is visibly humiliated and upset ( while Dwight is actually amused ) , and asks Andy ( who was out of the room at the announcement ) to take her home . </P> <P> However , the truth is eventually revealed in `` The Duel '' , when Michael decides to take the matter into his own hands , much to the objection of the staff by telling Andy the news . Devastated , Andy confronts Angela who tries to squirm her way out of the confrontation before admitting to the affair . This only sparks a duel between Andy and Dwight which seems to arouse Angela because of two men fighting over her . But that is short - lived when Andy tells Dwight that he slept with her twice in comparison to how many times Dwight has slept with her . Initially , Angela said that she only slept with Dwight . The two men break up with Angela with Andy making preparations to cancel the wedding and Dwight throwing out the bobblehead doll purchased for him as a gift by Angela . This all happens before her eyes , and a dejected expression appears on her face . </P> <P> In `` Stress Relief '' , Dwight traps all of the employees in the office , while leading them to believe that it is on fire . Everyone panics and attempts to break out . Angela goes to get her cat , Bandit , who she is revealed to keep in a drawer by her desk . She sees Oscar climbing into the ceiling , and attempts to get him to save her cat by taking it with him , but he is ignoring her . She then attempts to throw Bandit up into the ceiling to Oscar , but this results in the cat going up into one part of the ceiling , and coming down hard out of another part . She later takes part in the roast and during an interview expresses amusement over it , before she realizes she is sounding human and puts her stern facial expression back in place . </P> <P> In `` Blood Drive '' , Angela reveals that she once had two men duel over her , and everyone thinks she means Andy and Dwight , but she corrects them : two men named John ( John Mark and John David ) once fought for her affections in Ohio ( which both Dwight and Andy are bewildered by ) . She also goes out of her way to tell Oscar she does n't approve of his homosexuality , even though she also seems generally sympathetic to his tale of romantic failure . </P> <P> In `` New Boss '' , she , along with Kelly , develops a crush on Charles Miner , the new Vice President . It leads to the women battling for his affections , with Angela insulting Kelly in an interview by saying Charles is an attractive and cultured man and `` He does not need to go Dumpster - diving for companionship ! '' . </P> <P> In `` Company Picnic '' , Dwight 's friend , Rolf , constantly insults Angela on her relationship with Dwight , telling her that he does not hear `` Cheaters , Tramps , or Women who break his friends heart , '' after she wants to play in the volleyball game . However , by the end , Dwight defends Angela , indicating that their relationship may be thawing as the season ends . </P> <P> In `` Niagara '' , Angela implies she has no living grandmothers when hearing Pam talk about hers . At the wedding , she refuses to dance down the aisle like everyone else , and simply just walks down . </P> <P> In `` Murder '' , Angela takes part in Michael 's murder mystery game but is uncomfortable at being assigned the role of a voodoo priestess . </P> <P> In `` The Delivery '' , Angela and Dwight make a contract to have a baby , a prospect which brings visible joy to Angela . She makes several attempts to strike up conversations with Dwight while negotiating the contract , indicating that Angela sees the contract as her opportunity to reconcile with Dwight , but she either does n't notice or ignores Dwight 's clear unease after he signs the contract . However , in `` Happy Hour '' , Dwight makes clear both his interest in Pam 's friend Isabel Poreba and his decision to nix his deal with Angela . Angela is angry and appears with a court summons ordering Dwight to honor the contract , but he is unmoved and ends up making out with Isabel , while Angela yells she will see him in small claims court . </P> <P> In `` Secretary 's Day '' , Angela is upset when Erin learns that Andy was engaged to her , not because she 's jealous of Andy and Erin 's relationship , but due to her disgust over everyone knowing she had sexual relations with Andy ( which at least does confirm Andy 's statement in `` The Duel '' that she and he slept together a few times ) ; Erin does n't want to hear it or talk to Angela any further . However , it appears as if Angela 's relationship with Andy has at least become friendly at this point , as he specifically thanks her for her help with Erin 's party , to which she responds with a broad smile . </P> <P> In `` The Chump '' , Dwight and Angela call upon a mediator to settle their contract . The mediator determines that the otherwise ' solid ' contract is ultimately unenforceable , since you ca n't force two people to have sex and make a baby . Instead , Angela could sue Dwight for damages up to thirty thousand dollars for breach of contract . Knowing that Dwight would never want to pay her damages , she offers him a ' settlement ' ; five separate sessions of intercourse instead . He accepts , gloating that `` thirty thousand for sex is n't bad at all '' . Later , Dwight is seen carrying out various methods to try to sterilize himself before the first ' session ' . The episode ends with the two returning to the secret location in the warehouse to have sex . The pair do n't notice , however , that Jim and Pam are nearby attempting to take a nap and they can hear everything that is happening . </P> <H3> Season 7 -- 8 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In `` Andy 's Play '' , she has Dwight take her to the Sweeney Todd community production that Andy is a part of . During the play , she attempts to seduce Dwight by changing into tight gardening clothing ( she intentionally sticks gum on her dress so as to have an excuse to change ) . Dwight slowly appears to be falling for her again , and near the end of the episode , attempts to seduce her in return . Before they go too far , she cuts off the sex and drives away in her car ( while she 's driving , we see a visibly pleased expression on her face ) . </P> <P> In `` Viewing Party '' , she and Dwight agree to have sex during the night as part of their contract . However , Pam and Jim prevent him from going to Angela due to the fact that their baby seems to be attracted to Dwight , so she 's left waiting in the back seat of her car , visibly topless when Pam comes out to see her . </P> <P> In `` WUPHF.com '' , Dwight 's hay festival distracts him from fulfilling a request for sex from Angela ( per their contract ) . Angela 's at her most irritated when she meets a charming , friendly single father named Robert Lipton whom she actually finds herself smiling at and enjoying the company . When Angela learns the man is a widower , she makes it clear he 's welcome to call her . When Dwight is done with the festival , he arrives at his and Angela 's warehouse rendezvous point only to see that Angela has stamped their procreation contract VOID . </P> <P> In `` Classy Christmas '' , it 's revealed that Robert is actually a state senator ( although Angela only refers to him as the ' Senator ' , making it seem that he is a U.S. Senator like Bob Casey or Pat Toomey ) . She brings him to the office Christmas party , where she announces that they 're officially dating . However , Oscar picks up hints about his attraction to other men ( such as glancing at Ryan 's backside ) . Throughout the next few episodes , Angela continues her gloating about Robert 's job ( at one point trying to impress Deangelo Vickers with the information ) . The rest of the office staff make fun of this , particularly Michael during his last Dundies ceremony . </P> <P> There are further hints of her boyfriend 's homosexuality ( or bisexuality ) . In `` Goodbye , Michael '' , she shows off pictures of her and Robert together with his male ' aide ' . The pictures seem to heavily imply that he 's gay ( with the aide supposedly being his secret lover ) but Angela remains oblivious . </P> <P> In `` Search Committee '' , she receives a call from his secretary and is told to meet him at a particular restaurant for lunch . She comes back , having ridden in his limo , and shows the staff a ring on her finger . She tells him how he took her to a replica of a bridge , got down on one knee , and proposed . Immediately after this , she criticizes Jim 's informal proposal to Pam and their `` ironic wedding '' . Oscar , who strongly believes that Robert is gay , shares his feelings with Pam and the rest of the office ; Ryan Howard states that Robert is definitely gay because he liked a Facebook picture at 3 o'clock in the morning . The office eventually decides not to share their suspicions with Angela out of respect for her feelings , although Angela 's constant obnoxious and upbeat attitude about her forthcoming nuptials annoys Pam to the point where she nearly tells Angela the truth about Robert before stopping herself short . </P> <P> Midway through season eight , in `` Jury Duty '' , Angela gives birth to her son Philip ( much to Pam 's chagrin who wanted that name for her son ) . Angela claims that he was born prematurely , but when her co-workers visit her at the hospital and see how large the baby is , she is forced to admit that the baby was conceived before her wedding . This leads Dwight to suspect that the baby may be his , but later in `` New Guys '' , it is revealed that Dwight is not the father . </P> <H3> Season 9 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In `` The Whale '' , Angela suspects that Robert is cheating on her and after confiding this to Oscar , they follow Robert to his gym . When they see Robert acting intimately with a male trainer , Oscar 's odd reaction leads Angela to finally suspect that Oscar may be the one having an affair with Robert . In `` The Target '' , Angela seeks revenge on Oscar and hires a hitman to attack him but is later talked out of it by Dwight . Oscar allows her to kick him in the shin instead . Angela and Oscar 's battles for the affections of Robert continue uncomfortably when Oscar attends Angela 's son 's birthday party in `` Vandalism '' . </P> <P> In `` Moving On ( The Office ) '' , Angela and Dwight become close after she helps him take care of his elderly aunt . They share a kiss but afterwards both say that she should remain faithful to her husband . </P> <P> Angela becomes jealous when Dwight begins courting his neighbor Esther . ( `` Promos '' ) </P> <P> After the Senator 's public coming - out in `` Stairmageddon '' , she explains to the camera crew in `` Paper Airplane '' that she and the Senator are separated and that she now lives with her son Philip and her cats in her studio apartment . In `` Livin ' the Dream '' , it is implied that her cats have been taken away from her by Animal Control , and that she is considering living in a tent in the woods . Instead , she accepts an offer from Oscar Martinez to be his roommate until she is able to find a permanent home . She then breaks down in Oscar 's car , revealing to Oscar that she still loves Dwight . She and Oscar become close friends as he supports her in her return to normalcy , and it 's revealed that Oscar is Philip 's godfather . </P> <P> In the series finale , Angela and Dwight marry and it is revealed that Dwight is in fact the father of her son . </P> <H2> Recurring jokes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Throughout the show , Angela has always seemed reluctant to apologize and or accept blame for anything . In the episode The Alliance , Michael scolds the Party Planning Committee for doing a bad job with the streamers . Angela responds , `` Phyllis wanted red . I did n't . '' In reality , Angela rejected Phyllis ' suggestion of orange streamers , because `` orange is whorish '' . In one of the webisodes for The Accountants , Angela insists that she is not the source of the accounting discrepancy . When the error is revealed to be hers in `` The Best Day of My Life '' , she initially denies that she made the error , but when Oscar points out that this implies that she allowed an unknown person to access her books , she is forced to admit , `` Very well . Case closed '' . In A Benihana Christmas , Angela says that she has not spoken to her sister in 16 years over some disagreement she does not even remember . In The Return , Angela is forced to admit that she failed to submit important documents , but she blames Kevin for failing to remind her . In Product Recall , Angela is pressured to apologize to Oscar and Kevin for insulting them but she can only say `` I 'm sorry ... that you 're both morons '' . In that same episode , she finds herself unable to apologize to customers on behalf of Dunder Mifflin and can only say `` the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic '' . </P> <H2> Behind the scenes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Actress Angela Kinsey infused her character with some of her own personal preferences , including bobble - head dolls , cats , party - planning and Baby Ruth candy bars .

      "long_answer": "Dwight is the only person that Angela likes in the office . It is shown in `` E-mail Surveillance '' that Dwight and Angela have begun a romantic relationship . Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him , she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship , and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight 's passion for her . Their relationship is seemingly summarized in `` A.A.R.M. '' : when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses `` how loudly I love you '' , Angela meekly whispers `` It 's too loud . '' In `` Traveling Salesman '' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate , so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them . After Dwight is told he would be fired if he did n't tell Michael why he went to New York , he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela . Angela later tells Michael what happened , but still does n't reveal their relationship . In `` Fun Run '' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles , who is feeling sick , but Dwight kills it , which causes Angela to break up with him . After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4 , she stops dating Dwight , but at the end of `` Goodbye Toby '' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight . Dwight ends their affair in `` The Duel '' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy . In `` The Delivery '' Dwight , who wants to improve his sales by having a child , asks Angela to have his baby . The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together , but in `` Happy Hour '' , Dwight hooks up with Pam 's friend Isabel , and tells Angela he does n't want her to have his baby . In `` The Chump '' the two call in a lawyer , and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times . She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton . After she gives birth ( Jury Duty ) , Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he , not Robert , is the father . Angela and Dwight go through a paternity test and in `` New Guys '' it is revealed that Dwight is not Philip 's father . In `` A.A.R.M. '' Dwight proposes to Angela , and she accepts . She then tells Dwight that she lied before and Dwight is Philip 's father . Angela tells him that she wanted to make sure that Dwight wanted to marry her for no other reason than for love .",

It is algebraically simpler , though in practice less robust , than the average absolute deviation . A useful property of the standard deviation is that , unlike the variance , it is expressed in the same units as the data . There are also other measures of deviation from the norm , including average absolute deviation , which provide different mathematical properties from standard deviation . </P> <P> In addition to expressing the variability of a population , the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions . For example , the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times . This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the `` standard error '' of the estimate or `` standard error of the mean '' when referring to a mean . It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed . It is very important to note that the standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population ( such as the mean ) are quite different but related ( related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations ) . The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean ( or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size , which is the same thing ) and is typically about twice the standard deviation -- the half - width of a 95 percent confidence interval . In science , researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data , and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations away from what would have been expected are considered statistically significant -- normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations . The standard deviation is also important in finance , where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment . </P> <P> When only a sample of data from a population is available , the term standard deviation of the sample or sample standard deviation can refer to either the above - mentioned quantity as applied to those data or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation ( the standard deviation of the entire population ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Basic examples <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Sample standard deviation of metabolic rate of Northern Fulmars </Li> <Li> 1.2 Population standard deviation of grades of eight students </Li> <Li> 1.3 Standard deviation of average height for adult men </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Definition of population values <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Discrete random variable </Li> <Li> 2.2 Continuous random variable </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Estimation <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Uncorrected sample standard deviation </Li> <Li> 3.2 Corrected sample standard deviation </Li> <Li> 3.3 Unbiased sample standard deviation </Li> <Li> 3.4 Confidence interval of a sampled standard deviation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Identities and mathematical properties </Li> <Li> 5 Interpretation and application <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Application examples <Ul> <Li> 5.1. 1 Experiment , industrial and hypothesis testing </Li> <Li> 5.1. 2 Weather </Li> <Li> 5.1. 3 Finance </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.2 Geometric interpretation </Li> <Li> 5.3 Chebyshev 's inequality </Li> <Li> 5.4 Rules for normally distributed data </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Relationship between standard deviation and mean <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Standard deviation of the mean </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Rapid calculation methods <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Weighted calculation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 History </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Basic examples ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Sample standard deviation of metabolic rate of Northern fulmars ( edit ) </H3> <P> Logan gives the following example .

The graph shows the metabolic rate data , the means ( red dots ) , and the standard deviations ( red lines ) for females and males . </P> <P> </P> <P> Use of the sample standard deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars . If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population ( perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars ) , then instead of the sample standard deviation , the calculation would use the population standard deviation . In the population standard deviation formula , the denominator is N instead of N - 1 . It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population , so , by default , statistical software packages calculate the sample standard deviation . Similarly , journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified . </P> <H3> Population standard deviation of grades of eight students ( edit ) </H3> <P> Suppose that the entire population of interest was eight students in a particular class .

If the values instead were a random sample drawn from some large parent population ( for example , they were 8 marks randomly and independently chosen from a class of 2 million ) , then one often divides by 7 ( which is n \u2212 1 ) instead of 8 ( which is n ) in the denominator of the last formula . In that case the result of the original formula would be called the sample standard deviation . Dividing by n \u2212 1 rather than by n gives an unbiased estimate of the variance of the larger parent population . This is known as Bessel 's correction . </P> <H3> Standard deviation of average height for adult men ( edit ) </H3> <P> If the population of interest is approximately normally distributed , the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values . For example , the average height for adult men in the United States is about 70 inches ( 177.8 cm ) , with a standard deviation of around 3 inches ( 7.62 cm ) . This means that most men ( about 68 % , assuming a normal distribution ) have a height within 3 inches ( 7.62 cm ) of the mean ( 67 -- 73 inches ( 170.18 -- 185.42 cm ) ) -- one standard deviation -- and almost all men ( about 95 % ) have a height within 6 inches ( 15.24 cm ) of the mean ( 64 -- 76 inches ( 162.56 -- 193.04 cm ) ) -- two standard deviations . If the standard deviation were zero , then all men would be exactly 70 inches ( 177.8 cm ) tall . If the standard deviation were 20 inches ( 50.8 cm ) , then men would have much more variable heights , with a typical range of about 50 -- 90 inches ( 127 -- 228.6 cm ) . Three standard deviations account for 99.7 % of the sample population being studied , assuming the distribution is normal ( bell - shaped ) .

In cases where that can not be done , the standard deviation \u03c3 is estimated by examining a random sample taken from the population and computing a statistic of the sample , which is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation . Such a statistic is called an estimator , and the estimator ( or the value of the estimator , namely the estimate ) is called a sample standard deviation , and is denoted by s ( possibly with modifiers ) . However , unlike in the case of estimating the population mean , for which the sample mean is a simple estimator with many desirable properties ( unbiased , efficient , maximum likelihood ) , there is no single estimator for the standard deviation with all these properties , and unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a very technically involved problem . Most often , the standard deviation is estimated using the corrected sample standard deviation ( using N \u2212 1 ) , defined below , and this is often referred to as the `` sample standard deviation '' , without qualifiers . However , other estimators are better in other respects : the uncorrected estimator ( using N ) yields lower mean squared error , while using N \u2212 1.5 ( for the normal distribution ) almost completely eliminates bias . </P> <H3> Uncorrected sample standard deviation ( edit ) </H3> <P> The formula for the population standard deviation ( of a finite population ) can be applied to the sample , using the size of the sample as the size of the population ( though the actual population size from which the sample is drawn may be much larger ) . This estimator , denoted by s , is known as the uncorrected sample standard deviation , or sometimes the standard deviation of the sample ( considered as the entire population ) , and is defined as follows : </P> <Dl> <Dd> s N = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N ( x i \u2212 x _\u0304 ) 2 , ( \\ displaystyle s_ ( N ) = ( \\ sqrt ( ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( N ) ) \\ sum _ ( i = 1 ) ^ ( N ) ( x_ ( i ) - ( \\ overline ( x ) ) ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) , ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> where ( x 1 , x 2 , ... , x N ) ( \\ displaystyle \\ scriptstyle \\ ( x_ ( 1 ) , \\ , x_ ( 2 ) , \\ , \\ ldots , \\ , x_ ( N ) \\ ) ) are the observed values of the sample items and x _\u0304 ( \\ displaystyle \\ scriptstyle ( \\ overline ( x ) ) ) is the mean value of these observations , while the denominator N stands for the size of the sample : this is the square root of the sample variance , which is the average of the squared deviations about the sample mean . </P> <P> This is a consistent estimator ( it converges in probability to the population value as the number of samples goes to infinity ) , and is the maximum - likelihood estimate when the population is normally distributed . However , this is a biased estimator , as the estimates are generally too low . The bias decreases as sample size grows , dropping off as 1 / N , and thus is most significant for small or moderate sample sizes ; for N > 75 ( \\ displaystyle N > 75 ) the bias is below 1 % . Thus for very large sample sizes , the uncorrected sample standard deviation is generally acceptable . This estimator also has a uniformly smaller mean squared error than the corrected sample standard deviation . </P> <H3> Corrected sample standard deviation ( edit ) </H3> <P> If the biased sample variance ( the second central moment of the sample , which is a downward - biased estimate of the population variance ) is used to compute an estimate of the population 's standard deviation , the result is </P> <Dl> <Dd> s N = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N ( x i \u2212 x _\u0304 ) 2 .

The bias in the variance is easily corrected , but the bias from the square root is more difficult to correct , and depends on the distribution in question . </P> <P> An unbiased estimator for the variance is given by applying Bessel 's correction , using N \u2212 1 instead of N to yield the unbiased sample variance , denoted s : </P> <Dl> <Dd> s 2 = 1 N \u2212 1 \u2211 i = 1 N ( x i \u2212 x _\u0304 ) 2 .

Instead , s is used as a basis , and is scaled by a correction factor to produce an unbiased estimate .

The result is that a 95 % CI of the SD runs from 0.45 \u00d7 SD to 31.9 \u00d7 SD ; the factors here are as follows : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Pr ( q \u03b1 / 2 < k s 2 \u03c3 2 < q 1 \u2212 \u03b1 / 2 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b1 , ( \\ displaystyle \\ Pr \\ left ( q_ ( \\ alpha / 2 ) < k ( \\ frac ( s ^ ( 2 ) ) ( \\ sigma ^ ( 2 ) ) ) < q_ ( 1 - \\ alpha / 2 ) \\ right ) = 1 - \\ alpha , ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> where q p ( \\ displaystyle q_ ( p ) ) is the p - th quantile of the chi - square distribution with k degrees of freedom , and 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ( \\ displaystyle 1 - \\ alpha ) is the confidence level . This is equivalent to the following : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Pr ( k s 2 q 1 \u2212 \u03b1 / 2 < \u03c3 2 < k s 2 q \u03b1 / 2 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b1 . ( \\ displaystyle \\ Pr \\ left ( k ( \\ frac ( s ^ ( 2 ) ) ( q_ ( 1 - \\ alpha / 2 ) ) ) < \\ sigma ^ ( 2 ) < k ( \\ frac ( s ^ ( 2 ) ) ( q_ ( \\ alpha / 2 ) ) ) \\ right ) = 1 - \\ alpha . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> With k = 1 , q 0.025 = 0.000982 ( \\ displaystyle q_ ( 0.025 ) = 0.000982 ) and q 0.975 = 5.024 ( \\ displaystyle q_ ( 0.975 ) = 5.024 ) . The reciprocals of the square roots of these two numbers give us the factors 0.45 and 31.9 given above . </P> <P> A larger population of N = 10 has 9 degrees of freedom for estimating the standard deviation . The same computations as above give us in this case a 95 % CI running from 0.69 * SD to 1.83 * SD . So even with a sample population of 10 , the actual SD can still be almost a factor 2 higher than the sampled SD . For a sample population N = 100 , this is down to 0.88 * SD to 1.16 * SD . To be more certain that the sampled SD is close to the actual SD we need to sample a large number of points . </P> <P> These same formulae can be used to obtain confidence intervals on the variance of residuals from a least squares fit under standard normal theory , where k is now the number of degrees of freedom for error . </P> <H2> Identities and mathematical properties ( edit ) </H2> <P> The standard deviation is invariant under changes in location , and scales directly with the scale of the random variable .

See computational formula for the variance for proof , and for an analogous result for the sample standard deviation . </P> <H2> Interpretation and application ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Prediction interval and Confidence interval Example of samples from two populations with the same mean but different standard deviations . Red population has mean 100 and SD 10 ; blue population has mean 100 and SD 50 . <P> A large standard deviation indicates that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean . </P> <P> For example , each of the three populations ( 0 , 0 , 14 , 14 ) , ( 0 , 6 , 8 , 14 ) and ( 6 , 6 , 8 , 8 ) has a mean of 7 . Their standard deviations are 7 , 5 , and 1 , respectively . The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7 . It will have the same units as the data points themselves . If , for instance , the data set ( 0 , 6 , 8 , 14 ) represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years , the standard deviation is 5 years . As another example , the population ( 1000 , 1006 , 1008 , 1014 ) may represent the distances traveled by four athletes , measured in meters . It has a mean of 1007 meters , and a standard deviation of 5 meters . </P> <P> Standard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty . In physical science , for example , the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated measurements gives the precision of those measurements . When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction , the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance : if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction ( with the distance measured in standard deviations ) , then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised . This makes sense since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur , if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified . See prediction interval . </P> <P> While the standard deviation does measure how far typical values tend to be from the mean , other measures are available . An example is the mean absolute deviation , which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance , compared to the root mean square distance inherent in the standard deviation . </P> <H3> Application examples ( edit ) </H3> <P> The practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the average ( mean ) . </P> Experiment , industrial and hypothesis testing ( edit ) <P> Standard deviation is often used to compare real - world data against a model to test the model . For example , in industrial applications the weight of products coming off a production line may need to comply with a legally required value . By weighing some fraction of the products an average weight can be found , which will always be slightly different to the long - term average . By using standard deviations , a minimum and maximum value can be calculated that the averaged weight will be within some very high percentage of the time ( 99.9 % or more ) . If it falls outside the range then the production process may need to be corrected . Statistical tests such as these are particularly important when the testing is relatively expensive . For example , if the product needs to be opened and drained and weighed , or if the product was otherwise used up by the test . </P> <P> In experimental science , a theoretical model of reality is used . Particle physics conventionally uses a standard of `` 5 sigma '' for the declaration of a discovery . A five - sigma level translates to one chance in 3.5 million that a random fluctuation would yield the result . This level of certainty was required in order to assert that a particle consistent with the Higgs boson had been discovered in two independent experiments at CERN , and this was also the significance level leading to the declaration of the first detection of gravitational waves . </P> Weather ( edit ) <P> As a simple example , consider the average daily maximum temperatures for two cities , one inland and one on the coast . It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland . Thus , while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature , the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as , on any particular day , the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one . </P> Finance ( edit ) <P> In finance , standard deviation is often used as a measure of the risk associated with price - fluctuations of a given asset ( stocks , bonds , property , etc . ) , or the risk of a portfolio of assets ( actively managed mutual funds , index mutual funds , or ETFs ) . Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and / or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions ( known as mean - variance optimization ) . The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases , the expected return on an investment should increase as well , an increase known as the risk premium . In other words , investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty . When evaluating investments , investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns . Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns . </P> <P> For example , assume an investor had to choose between two stocks . Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent , with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points ( pp ) and Stock B , over the same period , had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return , an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice , because Stock B 's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation ( greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return ) . Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment ( but also to exceed the initial investment ) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances , and is estimated to return only two percent more on average . In this example , Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent , plus or minus 20 pp ( a range of 30 percent to \u2212 10 percent ) , about two - thirds of the future year returns . When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future , an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp , or a range from 70 percent to \u2212 50 percent , which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return ( about 99.7 percent of probable returns ) . </P> <P> Calculating the average ( or arithmetic mean ) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset . For each period , subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean . Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset . The larger the variance , the greater risk the security carries . Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question . </P> <P> Population standard deviation is used to set the width of Bollinger Bands , a widely adopted technical analysis tool . For example , the upper Bollinger Band is given as x + n\u03c3 . The most commonly used value for n is 2 ; there is about a five percent chance of going outside , assuming a normal distribution of returns . </P> <P> Financial time series are known to be non-stationary series , whereas the statistical calculations above , such as standard deviation , apply only to stationary series . To apply the above statistical tools to non-stationary series , the series first must be transformed to a stationary series , enabling use of statistical tools that now have a valid basis from which to work . </P> <H3> Geometric interpretation ( edit ) </H3> <P> To gain some geometric insights and clarification , we will start with a population of three values , x , x , x . This defines a point P = ( x , x , x ) in R. Consider the line L = ( ( r , r , r ) : r \u2208 R ) . This is the `` main diagonal '' going through the origin . If our three given values were all equal , then the standard deviation would be zero and P would lie on L. So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the distance of P to L. That is indeed the case . To move orthogonally from L to the point P , one begins at the point : </P> <Dl> <Dd> M = ( x _\u0304 , x _\u0304 , x _\u0304 ) ( \\ displaystyle M = ( ( \\ overline ( x ) ) , ( \\ overline ( x ) ) , ( \\ overline ( x ) ) ) ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> whose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> ( show ) Derivation of M = ( x _\u0304 , x _\u0304 , x _\u0304 ) ( \\ displaystyle M = ( ( \\ overline ( x ) ) , ( \\ overline ( x ) ) , ( \\ overline ( x ) ) ) ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <P> M ( \\ displaystyle M ) is on L ( \\ displaystyle L ) therefore M = ( l , l , l ) ( \\ displaystyle M = ( l , l , l ) ) with l \u2208 R ( \\ displaystyle l \\ in ( \\ textbf ( R ) ) ) </P> <P> The line L ( \\ displaystyle L ) is to be orthogonal to the vector from M ( \\ displaystyle M ) to P ( \\ displaystyle P ) .

In a certain sense , the standard deviation is a `` natural '' measure of statistical dispersion if the center of the data is measured about the mean . This is because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point . The precise statement is the following : suppose x , ... , x are real numbers and define the function : </P> <Dl> <Dd> \u03c3 ( r ) = 1 N \u2212 1 \u2211 i = 1 N ( x i \u2212 r ) 2 .

( \\ displaystyle r = ( \\ overline ( x ) ). \\ , ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> Variability can also be measured by the coefficient of variation , which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean . It is a dimensionless number . </P> <H3> Standard deviation of the mean ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Standard error of the mean <P> Often , we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained . We can obtain this by determining the standard deviation of the sampled mean . Assuming statistical independence of the values in the sample , the standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by : </P> <Dl> <Dd> \u03c3 mean = 1 N \u03c3 ( \\ displaystyle \\ sigma _ ( \\ text ( mean ) ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( \\ sqrt ( N ) ) ) \\ sigma ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> where N is the number of observations in the sample used to estimate the mean .

However , in most applications this parameter is unknown . For example , if a series of 10 measurements of a previously unknown quantity is performed in a laboratory , it is possible to calculate the resulting sample mean and sample standard deviation , but it is impossible to calculate the standard deviation of the mean . </P> <H2> Rapid calculation methods ( edit ) </H2> See also : Algorithms for calculating variance <P> The following two formulas can represent a running ( repeatedly updated ) standard deviation .

      "long_answer": "In addition to expressing the variability of a population , the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions . For example , the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times . This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the `` standard error '' of the estimate or `` standard error of the mean '' when referring to a mean . It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed . It is very important to note that the standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population ( such as the mean ) are quite different but related ( related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations ) . The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean ( or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size , which is the same thing ) and is typically about twice the standard deviation -- the half - width of a 95 percent confidence interval . In science , researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data , and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations away from what would have been expected are considered statistically significant -- normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations . The standard deviation is also important in finance , where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment .",

( It should be noted that Earth Sciences is not actually a course offered in Alberta - parts of geological science are included in various other science courses in the province . This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show . ) Amy is forced to choose between her love of healing troubled horses and living up to her father 's show jumping expectations . With no way to balance it all , Amy makes the hard decision to quit show jumping and sell Storm . This allows her to focus on her grades , chores , and work with horses . Meanwhile , Lou is searching for dude ranch horses and she is at odds with Tim over which horses to buy .

Lou pushes them out the door as fast as possible , as she has planned a romantic weekend at the ranch with Scott . Their plans change because Scott happens to be on call , and the dude ranch 's first customers arrive a week early : an odd middle - aged couple who are travel bloggers , and Lou goes out of her way to please them , thinking that their reviews could make or break her new venture . Lucky for Lou , they do n't hold a grudge ; she backed into their car after having lunch with Marnie at Maggie 's , before they got to the ranch . While on the cattle drive , Amy and Ty talk for the first time about his absence and clear the air between them . Ty comes close to telling Amy how he feels , and they kiss .

Caleb bails on leading the trail ride because it would have meant Amy and Ty could have a romantic evening alone at the ranch . Amy helps Lou instead and takes Copper , who is a better trail horse , despite Mallory 's protests . When Amy is gone , Mallory does a bit of jumping on Spartan , then takes him on a ride . While checking a log on the trail to make sure it 's safe to jump , Mallory does n't notice Spartan leave . She finds him grazing at the side of the road relatively quickly , but does n't notice the signs indicating recent pesticide application . Once they return to the ranch , it becomes evident something is wrong , which Ty correctly guesses to be pesticide poisoning . Ty looks into Marion 's notebooks , and gets Mallory 's help to mix charcoal and water . Caleb and his friend Kit , who Ty met accidentally while she was bathing in the pond early that morning , show up . Ty explains the situation , and they get Spartan to drink all the jugs of charcoal water together . Meanwhile , Lou 's friends work out their problems with each other , themselves , and their love lives , on the overnight trip that Lou , Tim , Amy , and Jack took them on .

She discovers the connection to the trauma of Constable Rodriguez 's brother drowning six years earlier , for which he still feels responsible , and ends up helping both the horse and the officer . Lou goes to a polo match for Nick Harwell 's polo team , as he gave her a number of free tickets , and upsets Scott when Nick talks about hiring him and Lou praises his work . Scott and Lou talk about the state of their relationship , and they break up for real . Lisa tries to convince Jack to go to the polo match with her , but he refuses . She even goes to the trouble of getting him a new suit so he wo n't stand out , but he still refuses . But he shows up just as the match starts and apologizes to Lisa for being so stubborn . Ashley takes Caleb to the polo club with her and shares her new pursuit of barrel racing ( which Kit is teaching her ) with her mother 's friends , much to Val 's chagrin . Ty asks Amy out on a date , but she already has plans with Caleb . Mallory tries to get rid of Jake , using lame excuses to avoid seeing him and ignoring his phone calls .

Amy and Caleb compete in team roping and he also competes in bronc riding , earning him the all - around cowboy buckle at the rodeo . Soraya , Lou , Ashley , and Kit compete for the title Queen of the Rodeo . Kit wins , Soraya is runner - up , and Ashley is second runner - up . Ty competes in bull riding when someone who was entered does n't show up , and Amy becomes upset , concerned for his safety , as bull riding seems to be perceived as the most dangerous event . Amy seems concerned over Ty and Kit 's budding friendship . Ashley is noticeably upset at the party that follows the rodeo and is drinking quite heavily , and Amy learns from her that Apollo , Ashley 's show jumping horse and the only horse that she had a bond with , has been sold . By the end of the night , Ashley is too intoxicated to take herself home , so Amy drives . She takes her eyes off the road and swerves , then Ashley yanks the wheel and they go off the road . Ty and Kit are headed home in his truck , and they help the girls . The next morning , Ty takes the blame for the accident , as Ashley was drunk and Amy has only a Class 7 license ( learner 's permit ) , as she has n't taken the basic road test to earn her Class 5 Probationary license yet . Ashley goes home with her mother , who is angry over the $3700 in damages to Ashley 's BMW . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 21 </Th> <Td> 8 </Td> <Td> `` Summer 's End '' </Td> <Td> Don McBrearty </Td> <Td> Heather Conkie </Td> <Td> November 29 , 2008 ( 2008 - 11 - 29 ) </Td> <Td> 208 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> It 's the end of summer in Hudson , and the weather is sweltering . While most of the family are awake because of the heat , Brad Borden ( Ty 's father ) comes to Heartland with six horses in a livestock trailer designed for cattle . One of the horses is down on the floor with a bad head wound , and Jack is forced to do the merciful thing , though Amy is desperate to prevent it . The other five horses are badly dehydrated and in rough shape , but able to wait until morning , when Scott can get to Heartland from Red Deer . Amy has a feeling that she knows one of the horses , and after cleaning his face , realizes that it is Ashley 's former jumper , Apollo . When Amy calls Ashley , she is distraught thinking that her mother sold Apollo to a meat truck . In fairness , Val thought that the horse dealer she sold to was reputable . Ashley smashes the windows of Val 's SUV with a golf club and runs away from home , despite Val 's threats to cut her off financially . Ashley spends much of the episode working and living at the dude ranch , and considering dropping out of high school . Ty is upset with his father for leaving him alone in Calgary , resulting in the men Brad owed money to tracking Ty down and beating him up several times . Father and son spend some time talking and they make peace , even talking about taking a trip to the Grand Canyon together . Amy , Ty , Caleb , and Mallory care for the horses , and this heavy episode is lightened by Mallory 's efforts to stay cool , standing in front of the open fridge and taking a cool bath with several bags of ice . There 's even a lighthearted water fight while the four of them are washing down the horses one evening . Amy and Ty are getting closer to where they left things before Ty went to Calgary . When the rain finally comes and cools off the heat , they go outside and kiss , but Ty breaks it off , worrying he is like his dad and saying he does n't want to hurt Amy . Once the horses are cared for , Lou deals with the logistics by making a deal with their owner ( a horse dealer ) to buy the five healthy horses for $2000 . However , Brad takes the money and leaves abruptly in the middle of the night , after receiving a call from the men that are still expecting his to return their money . Constable Rodriguez comes to the rescue when it looks like the horses will have to go back to the dealer , and the family keep the horses to use on trail rides for the dude ranch . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 22 </Th> <Td> 9 </Td> <Td> `` Showdown !

However , there have been some mysterious cattle rustlers roaming about stealing many ranchers ' cows and the ranchers are getting worried . Tim is one such rancher , and he hires both Caleb and Ty to watch his herd . This angers Amy , as she knows they wo n't have enough time to do most of the regular chores at the ranch as well . When she expresses this anger to Caleb , he kisses her and tells her that she thinks too much . The next day , Ty and Kit are having fun while working on schoolwork in the back of his truck , and they kiss . By this time , they had become close , and she had helped Ty apply to take online courses to complete his high - school diploma . Mallory discovered at the start of the episode that her parents had important news that could only be shared face - to - face . Her father has a gold record , and is going on tour to promote it . Since they ca n't be around to take care of her , Mallory is to be sent to Blessed Virgin Academy , an all - girls boarding school . There is a touching moment as she leaves the ranch . The tension continues to increase in this episode , as the ranchers become more and more concerned about their cattle . The police try to help track the rustlers , but they work swiftly , observing herds from a helicopter , then cutting fence lines and rounding up the cattle , driving them into a livestock trailer and escaping . Lou feels torn , as she has started seeing Mark Rodriguez , to whom her father is becoming increasingly hostile , feeling that the constable is inept at his job of preventing livestock theft . The episode reaches its climax when Ty and Caleb watch as the cattle rustlers turn up to steal Tim 's herd of cattle . Amy rides off in search of the ranch hands when she finds no work completed in the barn , and comes across the same scene , but one of the rustlers causes Spartan to rear , dropping Amy to the ground . Ty and Caleb come to help her , and she manages to escape , but the rustler has a gun and they stop advancing towards the scene of the crime . Jack drives up with Tim in tow , tipped off by Ashley , and try to stop the rustlers , but they are outnumbered . Amy sees this , and comes running towards them , calling , `` Dad ! '' The rustlers turn , guns in hand , and shoot towards her ; Tim takes a bullet to protect Amy . The episode ends on a cliffhanger , with no indication of where the bullet got Tim or whether he will survive , and the cattle rustlers drive off with his entire herd ( minus the two longhorns ) . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 23 </Th> <Td> 10 </Td> <Td> `` True Enough '' </Td> <Td> Sudz Sutherland </Td> <Td> Heather Conkie </Td> <Td> January 4 , 2009 ( 2009 - 01 - 04 ) </Td> <Td> 210 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> The episode prolongs the cliffhanger as long as possible , not referring to what happened to Tim , showing an influx of food from friends of the family ( which usually corresponds with a funeral ) and a conversation between Lou and Jack about Amy , saying that it 's good she went on a ride . She is even seen riding past the cemetery where her mom was buried in the first episode . Tim turns out to have been injured in his right shoulder , and he is wearing a sling . Tim becomes a source of tension in the household , constantly ringing a bell and expecting to be served . Amy is feeling guilty for being the cause of his bullet wound ( although indirectly ) , and she heals while caring for another horse . Amy 's teacher , Ruth Adams , is trying to sell her father 's old chestnut , Boxer . Amy and Ty try to help him settle in while they work on rehoming him , by bringing Hank Adams to visit his horse . While he is there , Ruth shows up , very upset that her father was brought to the ranch , revealing that Hank has Alzheimer 's . Despite being fuzzy about who his daughter is , Hank clearly remembers Boxer and even Jack . Jack eventually remembers that Hank was the lead guitarist for his wife , Lyndy , when she was a singer professionally . Jack had brought out an old record of hers to listen to , and they listen to it while talking with the Adams . Hank spontaneously picks up a guitar and starts playing the song in time with the record . In the end , Amy offers to keep Boxer so that Hank can visit him while he is able , and Ruth accepts this offer . While Tim is wearing out his welcome with Jack , Callie Phillips shows up and starts taking care of Tim . It seems they have been seeing each other since the cattle drive earlier in the season , and she stays at Big River whenever she is in town . This is quite a shock to the girls , who had no idea that Tim had a girlfriend . Amy is the least comfortable with it , and is fairly rude to Callie while she stays with them overnight . In the meantime , Lou is still seeing Mark , and enjoying it , even making him a mixed CD of police - related songs ( whether by theme or artists ' name ) . However , they were supposed to take a trip to the Banff Springs Hotel and have lunch there , but Mark says he is busy going to a provincial review meeting in Edmonton . This turns out to be a lie when Lou sees him kissing a blonde in Hudson , in his truck . He tries to explain that he did n't think they were exclusive , but Lou dumps him without a second thought . Ty is on a date with Kit , and Caleb tells Amy that Ty gave her up too easily . Caleb then shares a kiss with an enthusiastic Amy . Callie and Tim get in a fight , but get back together , and she takes him back to Big River , and finally out of Jack 's hair . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 24 </Th> <Td> 11 </Td> <Td> `` Starstruck !

Mallory is found hiding in one of the dude ranch cabins , having been aided in her ' escape ' from the boarding school by Jake . Mallory collects items Mindy has used around Heartland , planning to sell them on eBay so she can repay Jake for the money he spent helping her . Mindy digs into the Ty / Amy / Caleb ' triangle ' , lying to all three about what the others had said and attempts to pit the three against each other . She attacks Amy in particular for being unable to choose between Ty and Caleb or express how she feels about either guy . When Mindy ropes Caleb into taking her on a trail ride , she insists on riding an ailing Pegasus , ignoring Amy 's warning that the horse should not be used . This results in a calculated photo - op for Mindy with paparazzi tipped off by her agent . The photographers get too close and spook Pegasus , dropping Mindy off his back , but causing stone bruises and a chipped bone for Pegasus . Lou eventually kicks Mindy out for behaving as a spoiled rich girl and disrupting the peace at Heartland , and she drives off into the sunset . She does leave Amy a parting gift , in the form of a very flashy , one of a kind belt , which was for sale at Maggie 's for $995 . Amy promptly gives this to Soraya , with whom she was fighting over Amy 's not sharing that Mindy was taking riding lessons at Heartland . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 25 </Th> <Td> 12 </Td> <Td> `` Divorce Horse '' </Td> <Td> Dean Bennett </Td> <Td> Heather Conkie </Td> <Td> January 18 , 2009 ( 2009 - 01 - 18 ) </Td> <Td> 212 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> Mackenzie Hutton returns to Heartland with a fianc\u00e9 , Ian , who she met after dumping her real estate agent boyfriend in New York .

Lisa and Mackenzie 's mom convince her that she would be happier with a sit - down reception dinner and a tent and roses and peonies for table settings , rather than what she and Ian had been hoping for . Lisa also meddles in Lou 's personal life , giving her email to a friend , who passed it on to another friend 's single son . Peter , the young man , emails Lou , but she has to decide if she wants to respond . In the meantime , Amy has been treating another horse for Lisa , an Andalusian beauty named Diva . Lisa claims the horse is cursed , calling her `` Diva girl , the divorce horse '' , as everyone who has owned the horse has become divorced . She is moody and temperamental , and Lisa asks Amy to figure her out , since Diva has been returned three times after being rehomed . With Ty and Caleb 's help , Amy determines that Diva just needs to be a horse , and hates to be kept in a stall . Unfortunately , this means that Lisa can not sell her as a show horse . She ultimately decides to give Diva to Mackenzie , who had taken a real shine to her , and would be able to keep her at her inlaws ' ranch in Montana . While Mackenzie and Ian had been fighting during the episode over whether to even get married after their plans were hijacked , they resolve their differences and remember how much they love one another . The episode ends with Mackenzie and Ian saying their vows in the company of the Heartland family , at sunset in front of the dude ranch cabins and overlooking the pond . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 26 </Th> <Td> 13 </Td> <Td> `` Seismic Shifts '' </Td> <Td> TW Peacocke </Td> <Td> Susin Nielsen </Td> <Td> February 8 , 2009 ( 2009 - 02 - 08 ) </Td> <Td> 213 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> Bedford Oil comes to Hudson and begins to conduct oil exploration on Jack 's property , using seismic testing and exploratory oil wells . Mallory tells Lou that there is little to be done , as the oil companies can do as they please . Feeling shocked by the injustice of it , Lou mobilizes the community against Bedford . She holds a town hall meeting where she invites local community members , their MLA , and a representative from Bedford Oil , who shows up and turns out to be PW ( Peter Walter ) Morris , the company owner . Tim shares a contrasting perspective with Lou privately , saying that he would be glad to have a well installed on his property , for the royalties he would be paid . Mallory is reading Wuthering Heights and becomes convinced that Amy and Ty are Catherine and Heathcliff , meant to be together but thwarted by circumstance . Amy is working on desensitizing a horse named Acorn to noise and struggles to make progress with the oil company blasting at the edge of Jack 's land . Ashley and Caleb become roommates , as Ashley leaves Briar Ridge again after fighting with her mother . Mallory discovers that the two fishermen staying at the dude ranch are actually working for the oil company , when she is cleaning their cabin and discovers their fishing gear left behind . Lou kicks them out , though they protest that they had paid for several days more . Lou continues to hold a grudge against Lisa and avoid her company , though she continues to instant message with the man that Lisa gave Lou 's email to . By the end of the episode , Lisa apologizes to Lou and they have an honest conversation , making up in the process . Lou meets PW in town twice , spilling coffee on his shirt both times . He seems somewhat interested in her , but she shuts him down . Lou agrees to meet `` Internet guy '' as Mallory has dubbed him , who turns out to be none other than PW . Neither one of them were able to make the connection , though , as both used their first names - Peter and Samantha . Lou lets practical considerations ( the fact that Peter is `` an oil guy '' ) get in the way of having a relationship ( or even a date ) with Peter . Nonetheless , they wind up kissing on the street in front of Maggie 's . Lou starts to leave , returns to kiss him again , and then says that their attraction can not go anywhere , ending the episode on a small cliffhanger . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 27 </Th> <Td> 14 </Td> <Td> `` Do or Die '' </Td> <Td> TW Peacocke </Td> <Td> Mark Haroun </Td> <Td> February 15 , 2009 ( 2009 - 02 - 15 ) </Td> <Td> 214 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> Ty 's former probation officer , Clint , brings two troubled kids to the ranch , hoping that they can learn something from Ty and the ranch where he sorted out his problems . The two kids , Tara and Badger , seem to be at the far end of the spectrum relative to Ty , starting off their stay by burning an Adirondack chair at the dude ranch and putting peanut butter in the muffin Clint was eating -- knowing he was allergic to peanuts . Tara is a goth , and Badger is a boy who never talks . They clash with most of the family , and especially Mallory . Tara teases her by calling her a cheerleader , Hilary Duff , and similar names that reflect her perception of Mallory as a peppy `` nice girl '' . Ty and Badger fight from the beginning , when he refuses to put out his cigarette and later lets all of the horses in the barn out . Tara follows Ty around a bit , making reference to them being alike , thinking she knows his experiences . Mallory eventually makes peace with Tara by sharing her own story about her parents leaving her at Heartland to go on the road . Tara responds dismissively , but Mallory says she should realize that other people have problems too . After this , Tara comes around . Mallory even persuades her to take a riding lesson , making a deal with Tara that Mallory will try out the goth look and attitude in exchange . Amy takes them back to the dude ranch so that she can watch them and there will be enough room for everyone , then sits outside with Ty by the fire as Mallory and Tara have a pillow fight . Ty confides that he did n't want the other foster kids at Heartland because he does n't want to be a poster boy for the rehabilitation program . Ty reveals that his mother remarried a man who was horrible to them both . He made a vow to pay him back for the pain he inflicted , and when he did , the neighbours called the cops . At this point , Ty met Clint , who was supposed to deal with the hopeless cases . Amy is happy that Ty finally shared his story , and tells him that she 's happy Clint brought him to Heartland . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 28 </Th> <Td> 15 </Td> <Td> `` Dark Horse '' </Td> <Td> Dean Bennett </Td> <Td> Leila Basen and David Preston </Td> <Td> March 1 , 2009 ( 2009 - 03 - 01 ) </Td> <Td> 215 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> When a county by - law threatens to separate elderly Mrs. Bell from her beloved pony Sugarfoot , Lou revives the Hudson Charity Derby to raise money for a legal defense fund . This reawakens an old rivalry between Tim and Jack , who were the reason the derby became defunct many years previously . Both dispute who won , because Tim won by going off - course during the race . Both sign up for this derby to settle their score . Kit drops off her horse Money ( short for You 're so Money ) , whom she thought was a chuckwagon horse , to Heartland for rehoming . Scott looks at the horse and determines that he has a tattoo , meaning he was a racehorse . Ty looks up Money 's records and discovers that he was a success when racing . Amy helps get Tim 's palomino horse in shape for the race , as Tim is still having difficulty riding due to his shoulder . Ty helps Jack train on their `` secret weapon '' because Jack 's horse , Paint , is too old to race in the derby . Tim and Jack are doing well in the race , until Tim falls off his horse and Jack stops to help him . Scott wins the race and Tim and Jack tie for second ( although Tim 's horse was ahead by a little bit , if you watch closely ) . Amy and Ty are recruited to be spotters at the halfway point , which does n't work out , as the walkie talkies that Amy and Lou communicate on are unable to connect properly over such a distance . Ty and Amy start play - fighting and almost kiss . Ashley 's mom offers to sponsor Caleb so he can join the professional rodeo circuit and leave Hudson . This episode features some comic relief between Jack and Tim - Tim offers Jack hay , and Jack thinks it will be free . They haggle over price , and Jack plans to take the hay . They disagree later , and he comes back to return the hay . In all , the hay is lifted onto and taken off of the bed of Jack 's truck no less than four times . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 29 </Th> <Td> 16 </Td> <Td> `` The Ties That Bind '' </Td> <Td> Dean Bennett </Td> <Td> Penny Gummerson </Td> <Td> March 8 , 2009 ( 2009 - 03 - 08 ) </Td> <Td> 216 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> The episode opens with Amy and Spartan out on a ride as dusk is falling . For no clear reason , Spartan is acting a bit uneasy . This part of the episode is filmed as if through the eyes of someone watching Amy and her horse , always with trees between the scene and the audience . When they return to the barn , Amy also seems uneasy , and decides not to let Ty turn Spartan out with the other horses overnight . That night , Amy tosses and turns , seeing the night her mom died in her dreams , while Wes breaks into the barn and escapes with Spartan . When Amy wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to check on him , she discovers that Spartan is gone . The family speaks to the police to track Spartan , but Ty and Amy also spend the next couple weeks checking horse auctions to see if Spartan turns up . They visit the Highwood Auction , and Ty buys a two - year - old bay gelding named Harley . Amy is angry that he spent the money he 'd been saving for a motorcycle on a horse , but he says that he 's almost a motorcycle , due to the name . Amy starts to storm out , but Ty stops her when he sees Spartan turn up . Spartan is there and Wes buys him `` legally '' . Amy tries to prove that Spartan is her horse , but she does n't possess a bill of sale , and current registration papers do n't prove it without one . Wes is unable to leave with Spartan right away because Ty slashed his tires to ensure he could n't leave before they talked to the brand inspector . Ty chases down Wes later , hoping to buy Spartan back , but Wes refuses to sell him for any price . Amy later plans to return and steal Spartan from the auction house , and Ty tries to talk her out of it , saying it 's a felony . ( This is actually untrue in Alberta , as indictable offences are applied in Canada . This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show . ) In the end , Ty reluctantly agrees to help her that evening . Ty gets caught and taken to jail , where Jack bails him out , but he may still be convicted . Jack and Tim track down Wes and force him to sign a bill of sale , returning Spartan and preventing similar problems for Amy in the future . Jack also talks to Constable Rodriguez , who promises to destroy the file on Ty 's theft attempt . Ty instead has to do 200 hours of community service , and Amy is grounded until further notice . Mallory 's horse , Copper , is scared of her because of her `` goth '' look , so she returns to her normal style by the end of the episode . Lou is apprehensive of revealing to her family that she is dating an oil guy , and goes to extreme measures to avoid them seeing her with Peter . Caleb gets his rodeo card , and Val offers him a sponsorship to go on the road and stay away from Ashley . Caleb debates whether to take it , and talks to both Ty and Kit about it .

Peter books the entire dude ranch in order to spend time with Lou , who continues to keep him a secret from her family . Peter is forced to tell Lou he has an ex-wife when he has to take care of their dog , Max . Lou promises to let him meet her family , now that she knows more about his . Ty breaks Harley while Amy stays at Victor 's , but gets into a fight with Kit when she tries to show him her methods .

Jack says it will make them dependent on people . At dinner , Mallory reveals that Ty has earned his high school diploma and later tells Amy that he 's at a crossroads , and asks if Amy has any plans . She replies that she 's working on it . Her method is revealed when we see Amy talking about sneaking up to the fishing cabin with Ty to feed the horses , which will also give them a great opportunity to talk . Jack comes into the barn to tell them that it 's now necessary to feed the horses , and the three of them can go up that weekend . However , Lou has weekend plans and Mallory and Jake have nowhere to stay , so Jack winds up looking after them . This leaves Amy and Ty free to follow through with their plans , in the open . When they arrive , Amy and Ty spread out the hay for the horses , and Ty collapses after thinking he sees Ghost . ( This is the second time that Ghost shows up when Ty is in danger . ) Ty develops a high fever , but no one else can reach the fishing cabin because the highway is closed . Lou was heading to a spa with Peter along one of the mountain highways , but they were forced to turn back due to the closures . Lou made an attempt to tell Jack about Peter , but Mallory and Jake spilled something in the other room , and Jack took them to Maggie 's . When they return , Lou introduces Peter to Jack , who is incredibly unhappy that Lou is dating an oil guy , even calling him the enemy . However , after Amy contacts Jack via the cabin 's shortwave radio , Peter organizes snowplows to clear the highway in the morning , and Jack grudgingly accepts him . Amy cares for Ty overnight , and his fever eventually breaks . It turns out that Ghost really was there , not a hallucination of Ty 's brought on by illness . Upon seeing Ghost outside , the pair go out to greet him , and Amy begins to talk about what Ty said . She agrees they ca n't just be friends , admitting that she loves him . Ty finally tells Amy his feelings for her . Meanwhile , Val gets her test results back , and they are negative . Val tells Ashley that she sponsored Caleb , which causes Ashley to become upset with her mom and Caleb . When he returns to his trailer , Ashley kicks him out . Later , Val is driving along , and pulls over to answer her phone and discover that she needs further tests . Jack gives Tim a loan , since Tim was thinking of selling land to Val to be able to afford to continue after losing his herd of cattle , which would turn Val into Jack 's neighbour on both sides . Once they return to Heartland , Amy and Ty get cozy on the couch . He makes Amy say she loves him again , and they kiss . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Season 3 ( 2009 - 10 ) ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . overall </Th> <Th> No. in season </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Directed by </Th> <Th> Written by </Th> <Th> Original air date </Th> <Th> Prod . code </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 32 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Miracle '' </Td> <Td> Steve DiMarco </Td> <Td> Heather Conkie </Td> <Td> October 4 , 2009 ( 2009 - 10 - 04 ) </Td> <Td> 301 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> When a coach bus and a horse trailer collide on Highway 95 , they block the route for Amy 's school bus to get to her high school . Ignoring a command to stay on the bus , Amy goes to help Caesar , a grey gelding with Olympic prospects , stuck in a barbed wire fence . Amy calms him down while his trainer , Stuart Forrest , cuts the barbed wire to free him . When Amy turns around , a crowd has gathered to watch , with several individuals filming her . One of these recordings is presented on the news , causing Heartland to become famous overnight . Amy struggles to keep up with the pressure while trying to heal Caesar , who is spooked by loud noises , cars , and horse trailers after the accident . Amy earns the nickname `` Miracle Girl '' , which she likes even less than the comments of `` horse whispering '' when people talked about Marion 's and her gift previously . Ty applied for a vet program , and accepted an offer from Scott to apprentice / intern with him in the meantime . Ty begins to question his decision after his first job with Scott was to help at the scene of the accident , which included the euthanasia of a few severely injured horses . Caleb punches Ty for hurting Kit , saying that he had warned him not to . Jack lets Caleb stay in the loft with Ty , as Caleb is living in his truck , unable to get his trailer back from Ashley . She starts working at Maggie 's to afford to live on her own . Amy and Ty make plans to get Ashley and Caleb back together , so Ty does n't have to listen to his snoring . Lisa comes back from France and asks Jack if he misses her when she is away . Jack explains that he misses her , but there 's a lot going on at the ranch to occupy his time . Tim buys a new herd of cows with some of the money that Jack lent him . Jack gets upset , but Lisa tells him that he ca n't tell Tim how to use the loan . Jack asks Val about her deal with Tim , and she says there is n't one . He also asks her how she 's feeling , and she says that her doctor says she is in remission , but `` this blood thing 's a tricky customer '' . This seems to imply that Val had one of the blood cancers ( leukemia , lymphoma , or myeloma ) which was treated successfully in the time between seasons . Val has n't told Ashley , not wanting to worry her , and she thanks Jack for taking her to her appointments , saying he is a true friend . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 33 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Little Secrets '' </Td> <Td> Steve DiMarco </Td> <Td> Leila Basen and David Preston </Td> <Td> October 11 , 2009 ( 2009 - 10 - 11 ) </Td> <Td> 302 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> Amy finds herself caught in a family crisis when she tries to help a 10 - year - old girl , Taylor Kennedy , and her horse Trooper recover from what appears to be a freak accident . Taylor was in a full - body cast after Trooper started galloping apparently out of the blue , and she fell off . Trooper also lunges at Taylor when they first arrive , and Amy notes that she has only seen this with abused horses . Ty thinks it is unlikely that a young girl would abuse her horse , but Mallory cautions that they should n't underestimate Taylor . After Amy has been working with Trooper and Taylor together for a while , getting her to spend time with her horse and then grooming him together , she assesses that the horse is fine , and that perhaps the problem lies with Taylor . Amy also finds out that the Kennedys are getting divorced , and that Taylor will go to any lengths to get them to stay together . Taylor also almost hurts Trooper one night while he 's in Heartland 's care , advancing on him with a large branch in hand , while Mallory looks on . She also gets on and hits him with a riding crop to make him gallop like he did during the accident . Amy stops them before they reach a cliff , but then Taylor starts running . Amy catches her and reveals that she 's pieced together the mystery . When they return to the ranch , Amy takes Kate Kennedy aside and tells her that her daughter needs some professional help ( Amy says she can help Trooper , but she ca n't help Taylor ) . Amy offers to take care of Trooper while Taylor 's problems are sorted out , however long that takes . In the meantime , Heartland continues to be very busy thanks to Amy 's reputation as the `` Miracle Girl '' , meaning that Jack is making extra pens behind the barn to deal with more horses , and Lou and Tim are thinking about expansion plans for the dude ranch . Amy is also treating Roxy , a horse that is barn sour ( meaning she is reluctant to leave her stall ) . Ashley and Caleb continue to be at odds , and Amy brings Soraya into her and Ty 's plans to get them back together . The two girls talk to Ashley , but she has figured out what they are up to ( and why ) , and asks them to stay out of it . Lou continues to try to keep Amy 's schedule manageable , but Tim continues to interfere , promising service to people that Lou says will have to wait . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 34 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Man 's Best Friend '' </Td> <Td> Dean Bennett </Td> <Td> Heather Conkie </Td> <Td> October 18 , 2009 ( 2009 - 10 - 18 ) </Td> <Td> 303 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> Jack 's truck breaks down more and more often , causing Lisa and him to miss a wedding they were supposed to go to . Lisa and the rest of the family try to convince him to upgrade . They persuade him to visit the Chevy dealership , and he comes home with a new grey Silverado , after trading in his old truck for $1000 . However , he continues to complain about the truck , its seat settings , its lack of comfort , etc . He becomes upset , and takes the truck up to the fishing cabin . The family ca n't understand why Jack is so attached to his old truck , but the audience learns through a flashback sequence that Jack 's late wife , Amy and Lou 's grandmother , Lyndy bought him the 1972 Chevrolet Cheyenne 10 as an anniversary gift early in their marriage . In the meantime , Amy is trying to help a horse named Duke , whose stable - mate died recently , by trying to get him to bond with Pegasus . Mallory and Jake stop by , looking for Kramer , Jake 's black - and - white paint cow pony , who has a habit of escaping from pens by jumping the fences . When they find him , they ask Amy to solve his problem . Amy recognizes that the horse actually jumps fences without provocation , simply because he loves to jump . Amy 's solution is for Mallory to take Kramer around a jumping course regularly , to keep his extra energy in check and make him behave for Jake 's family . Kramer also helps Amy with Duke , because the two horses become fast friends . She is then able to get Duke to socialize with the other horses and to get over his grief . The end - of - school dance is also coming up fast , and Amy and Ty are supposed to go together . Amy was going to use one of Lou 's old dresses , but Lisa gives her a beautiful turquoise gown from Paris . Ty is worried because he does n't know how to dance , so he takes lessons from Lou ( and Peter , who 's back from a business trip to Dubai ) . Amy and Ty head out to their dance , but Ty 's truck breaks down . Instead , they wind up dancing in the bed of the truck , and Ty presents Amy with a promise ring . Ashley asks a rich boy from a private school to go with her as a date to the dance to make Caleb jealous . Caleb hitches his trailer to his truck , and tries to pull it away , but he and Ashley wind up laughing about it before she drives off with the other boy . Jack 's problems with the new truck are solved when he finds a used truck , much like his old one , but in much better shape . Old Goldie ( the old truck ) is brought back to the farm as a `` lawn ornament '' and sits beside another old , dead truck . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 35 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` The Haunting of Hanley Barn '' </Td> <Td> Dean Bennett </Td> <Td> Mark Haroun </Td> <Td> October 25 , 2009 ( 2009 - 10 - 25 ) </Td> <Td> 304 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> Something is scaring the horses at night in the Hanley Barn and Amy is called in to investigate . At first , Amy thinks it might be the feed , but Mr. Hanley rejects this suggestion as he 'd already talked about it with the vet . Amy agrees to come back that night to investigate further , and Ty comes with her at Jack 's request . Meanwhile , Badger returns to Heartland , having run away from his foster home to see his birth parents , but they had moved without leaving him any contact information . He talks to Ty about it , saying that he needs somewhere to stay overnight . Ty lets him stay temporarily , and Mallory finds Badger sketching by the lake . Both seem interested in each other , as Badger almost tells Mallory she looks more grown - up than before , and Mallory asks about Tara , who Badger seemed to be dating when they first showed up in Season 2 . Clint stops by looking for Badger , and Ty pretends he has n't seen him , to give Badger some time to cool off before having to return to his foster home . Mallory steals food for Badger , and the story returns to Amy . She and Ty are at Maggie 's , and Ty asks why everyone thinks the barn is haunted . Soraya , Amy , Ashley , and Mallory recount the tale : A young man was working at the Hanley place , and fell in love with the farmer 's daughter . One night , the barn erupted into flame and all the horses , as well as the young man , died in the fire . Shortly thereafter , Mr. Hanley 's parents bought the farm from the previous owners and they built a new barn on top of the original 's location . Now it is believed that The Drifter , the young man , haunts the barn , and he is portrayed as wearing a black cloak , with a hook for a hand , and no face under his hood . Just then , Caleb bangs in , wearing a heavy black cloak because the weather 's turning . Amy and Ty go to the Hanley place , and spend several hours just playing cards . While they are there , Caleb , Soraya , and Ashley show up to scare them ( in which they succeed ) . Noises come from upstairs , which Amy had noticed earlier in the day . Amy and Ty investigate , despite Mr. Hanley 's previous warning that the loft is strictly off - limits . They discover Mallory and Badger upstairs , and tell them to go home . At this point , Mr. Hanley appears and explains that the loft has dry rot , which is why he told Amy not to go upstairs . In the end , Amy discovers that Mr. Hanley 's neighbour , Brett , has been spiking the horses ' feed with a glycogen loader , meant to give horses energy , which is the reason they are so worked up in the morning . He wants to force Mr. Hanley into foreclosure , so he can buy the land . Once that problem 's solved , Ty decides to help Badger by coaching him through how to apologize to Clint , which Badger does . Ty also tells Badger to come back to Heartland if he runs away again , so that he 'll be safe . Later , Mallory flips through Badger 's sketchpad while he 's not around and sees a drawing of her . She asks him about it , and they wind up kissing . Lou is planning on visiting Peter in Denver , Colorado , for a single day while he has a layover on his way back to Dubai . Jack disapproves , and says it 's an awful long distance to travel for a single day together . Lou ca n't understand why he 's so easy on Amy and hard on her , but Jack eventually reveals it 's because Amy reminds him so much of Marion , and Lou reminds him of himself . He also says that he worries about when she 'll leave again , possibly for New York , or worse ( in his eyes ) , Toronto . Mrs. Bell comes over to use the kitchen to make strawberry jam with Lou 's help . While she 's there , Mrs. Bell reminisces , and tells Mallory , about Thomas Ritter ( aka The Drifter ) , her first boyfriend . She gave him a jar of jam , and he returned the empty jar with a butterfly in it . Towards the end of the episode , Mrs. Bell brings a butterfly in a jar to the grave at the Hanley farm where he was buried , and releases it in his memory . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 36 </Th> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> `` Glory Days '' </Td> <Td> Don McBrearty </Td> <Td> Leila Basen and David Preston </Td> <Td> November 1 , 2009 ( 2009 - 11 - 01 ) </Td> <Td> 305 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> In the hopes of impressing Ashley , Caleb takes lessons in bulldogging from former rodeo champion Tim , who considers getting back into competition , and refuses to acknowledge that he may no longer have what it takes . Amy helps them with this . Tim pays Jack back for his loan in cows , and Jack relives his glory days as well , working with the cattle herd . He realizes he ca n't do it alone , and gets Tim 's help , for a price . Tim wants a paycheque and grazing fees , meaning the herd of cattle might not be much of a return of the loan . Kit 's barrel horse is foaling , and Ty helps Scott check on the mare while waiting for her time to come . They talk , and Kit congratulates him on getting accepted to two pre-vet university programs ( at the University of Manitoba , and Grasslands Agricultural College ) . Kit says she knew he could do it , though he struggled with Grade 12 Algebra . ( This is another regional error : she means Math 30 Pure , as Alberta 's high school maths are broken down only into Pure ( university prep ) / Applied ( college prep ) and Math 31 ( calculus ) , not into algebra , geometry , etc. , like some other provinces . ) Ty assists Scott with the delivery , which is complicated by the fact that the foal is upside down . Its head and right foreleg get stuck while Scott tries to turn it , and the foal is stillborn . Kit and Ty sort out their lingering break - up issues while Ty comforts Kit , who is visibly upset . After the birth , the mare refuses to leave the dead foal alone , so they try to get her to bond with an orphaned foal , Merlin , instead . It 's hard going at first , but Amy comes over to help and rubs the foal with the blanket that was on the dead foal , making him smell like the mare 's foal . At that point , the mare accepts Merlin and he 's able to nurse , which seems to be a success . Lou invites Peter to manage his business from the Heartland facilities while his office in Calgary undergoes renovation , which soon turns out to be a mistake . Peter also interferes with Lou and Mallory 's agreement for Copper , telling Mallory that she has actually completely paid off her share of Copper 's ownership , and then some . Caleb repays Val for her sponsorship , and he talks about his reasons for trying bulldogging . He thinks it will be safer , but Tim later tells him that it 's even more dangerous than bronc riding , because there are more variables with more animals . Val tells Ashley that Caleb 's a good guy , and tells her that the money was repaid . Val asks Ashley to forgive her and give her a second chance and Ashley moves back to Briar Ridge .

It was released in August 2017 for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Microsoft Windows , OS X and Linux .

Players can use firearms and improvised weapons to defend against hostile humans and creatures , with the ability to build bases as defense . The game has both single - player and multiplayer options . </P> <P> Development began in October 2014 . The development team conducted research into the physical appearance of the animals , but took creative license for gameplay purposes . One of the game modes , Survival of the Fittest , was released as a free standalone game in March 2016 . Egypt - based developer Instinct Games was hired to facilitate the game 's development . Several expansions to the game have also been released as downloadable content : The Center , Primitive Plus , Scorched Earth , and Ragnarok . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Gameplay </Li> <Li> 2 Development </Li> <Li> 3 Sales </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Gameplay ( edit ) </H2> <P> Ark : Survival Evolved is an action - adventure survival game set in an open world environment and played either from a third - person or first - person perspective . To survive , players must establish a base , with a fire and weapons ; additional activities , such as taming and feeding dinosaurs , require more resources . The game 's world , known as the `` Ark '' , is approximately 48 km ( 19 sq mi ) in size : there is approximately 36 km ( 14 sq mi ) of land with 12 km ( 4.6 sq mi ) of ocean . </P> <P> To build a base , players must gain structure components -- such as floors , doors and windows built with the resources littered throughout the world -- which are earned as they progress and gain levels . These components can be crafted and placed in the world . Players can create any structure , as long as they have the logistics and resources ; the structural integrity of the building is compromised when the pillars and foundations are destroyed . Creating structures out of metal make them the most durable ; only titanosaurs and explosives can damage metal structures . Players can also craft items in the game , such as weapons , by collecting the resources and technology required for crafting . In addition , players can craft and attach accessories to their weapons , such as a scope or flashlight for a pistol or machine gun . Should players take damage , their health meter will gradually regenerate if they have consumed the necessary food , or if they craft items that regenerate the health meter at a faster pace . </P> <P> There are sixty species of dinosaurs in the game . Dinosaurs in the game can be tamed by feeding them food after they have been rendered unconscious , or by using kibble designed especially for each species . Once a dinosaur is tamed , players can utilize the dinosaur 's abilities , such as flight or fast underwater movement , as well as its statistics , such as speed , health and damage . When riding atop certain creatures , players can use their weapons . With the larger dinosaurs , other players can ride on the side with full control of their own weapons . They can also be used to carry items , and players can issue offensive and defensive commands to them ; for example , a pack of Utahraptors can be assigned to defend the base , or a group of Triceratops can be ordered to attack an enemy 's base . The game also features various other animals , such as the dodo , saber - toothed cat , woolly mammoth , Meganeura , Titanomyrma , and Doedicurus . Every creature in the game has living ecosystems and predator hierarchies . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> Preliminary work on Ark : Survival Evolved began in October 2014 . Studio Wildcard , the Seattle - based team behind the game , co-opted Egypt - based developer Instinct Games to facilitate development . When researching for information about the game 's prehistoric species , the development team read `` general audience books '' and online articles , and sought assistance from friends who studied in the fields in biological sciences . When creating the species and world , the team took creative license for gameplay purposes , although there is an in - game reason that the species have diverged from their historical counterparts . </P> <P> The team added features to the game that would appeal to all players , as opposed to specifically players of the survival genre , such as the ability to simply explore the island and compete against large bosses , as a reward for uncovering secrets of the island . They also added an end - game for players to strive towards , as they felt that most survival games lack a final goal . They wanted to `` provide a depth and scope that allows for the world to not just be a means to an end ( ... ) but also a place to explore '' , said creative director Jesse Rapczak . </P> <P> The game , powered by Unreal Engine 4 , contains `` tens of thousands '' of artificial intelligence entities , according to Rapczak . It also features support for virtual reality ( VR ) gameplay ; Rapczak , who has almost three years of experience with head - mounted displays , described the game as being designed with VR in mind from the beginning . </P> <P> The game was initially released through Steam Early Access for Microsoft Windows on June 2 , 2015 , for Linux and OS X on July 1 , 2015 , and through the Xbox Game Preview Program for Xbox One on December 16 , 2015 ; a PlayStation 4 version was released on December 6 , 2016 . The final game will launch in August 2017 ; it was originally intended for release in June 2016 , but was delayed in April . The game will launch with support for Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR , and the Xbox One version will be released via the ID@Xbox program . </P> <P> On March 16 , 2016 , the Survival of the Fittest game mode was released in early access as a free standalone game with no microtransactions ; it was scheduled to fully launch in mid 2016 , but was eventually merged back to the main game as the development team did not wish to monetize on its release , and wanted to ensure that modders can apply the development kit of Survival Evolved to create mods for Survival of the Fittest . There will be various eSports tournaments of the game mode , with a prize pool of US $50,000 . Players who played Survival of the Fittest before it was merged back into the main game can continue to play the game without paying an extra cost , while new players must pay before getting access to it . It will be available for every player who purchases the main game . </P> <P> On September 1 , 2016 , Studio Wildcard released the paid downloadable content ( DLC ) Scorched Earth . The expansion includes a new , desert map as well as several desert - themed resources and items . It also features ten new creatures , some of which are fictional , like the Wyvern . The release of paid DLC for a game still in early access caused negative reaction among players of the game , resulting in lots of negative reviews on Steam right after the expansion launch . </P> <P> The game left early access on August 29 , 2017 , for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One . The standard version was released alongside an `` Explorer 's Edition '' , which included a season pass with three expansions , and the `` Collector 's Edition '' , which included a season pass as well , a necklace , a map , a notebook , a development team poster , a wooden chest packaging , and the game 's official soundtrack . </P> <H2> Sales ( edit ) </H2> <P> Within a month of its early access release on Steam , Ark had sold over one million digital copies . By August 2016 , the game had over 5.5 million sales across both Windows and Xbox , with about 1.5 million from the Xbox One platform . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <P> Notes </P> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Fight for Life in Studio Wildcard 's ARK : Survival Evolved '' .

She first appeared in the show 's pilot , `` Our Very First Show '' , which aired in 1987 , and continued to appear throughout up to the two - part series finale , `` Michelle Rides Again '' in 1995 . The character of Michelle was the Olsen twins ' first acting role ; the two were infants when they started working on the series . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Character <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Friendships </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Comet the dog </Li> <Li> 3 Crediting </Li> <Li> 4 Reception </Li> <Li> 5 Book series </Li> <Li> 6 Fuller House </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Character ( edit ) </H2> <P> Michelle Tanner is the youngest member of the Tanner family , and is notable in the series for saying a string of precocious catchphrases such as `` you got it dude '' , `` you 're in big trouble , mister '' , `` no way , Jos\u00e9 ! '' and `` aw nuts ! '' . Raised by her father Danny Tanner , her uncle Jesse Katsopolis , and her father 's friend Joey Gladstone after her mother Pam 's death in a car accident caused by a drunk driver , Michelle debuted during her character 's infancy , maturing throughout the progression of the series . She is depicted as being slightly mischievous , though her status as the youngest daughter of the family leaves many of her misdeeds undisciplined and spares her from punishment -- much to the chagrin of her older sisters . </P> <P> Michelle is quite playful , being a young child ; however many episodes end with her realization of a vital moral . Having never interacted with her deceased mother , Michelle occasionally yearns for a mother of her own , and episode plots have surrounded her desire for a mother and her plans to attempt to gain one through her father Danny remarrying . She forms a very strong familial bond with Jesse and enjoys his company and playful teasing . She was the flower girl at his and Becky 's wedding . Their relationship is so strong that she becomes crestfallen upon learning of Jesse 's intended relocation from the Tanner household after his marriage to Rebecca Donaldson in the season four episode `` Fuller House '' . She holds a tendency to scheme when met with a new desire as an enhancement to the comedy of the series , but she eventually realizes the errors of her ways by the episode 's conclusion . </P> <P> From seasons six through eight ( as first established in `` Lovers and Other Tanners '' ) , Michelle is a `` Honey Bee '' in an organization which her sisters D.J. and Stephanie had previously participated in . Michelle attends Meadowcrest Preschool through seasons 3 - 4 and later , Frasier Street Elementary School through seasons 5 - 8 . </P> <H3> Friendships ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the season three episode `` Bye , Bye Birdie '' , on Michelle 's first day of preschool , she meets a boy named Aaron Bailey , who , that day , is able to wear the sharing crown because he brought his toys in . That day , the teacher calls the kids to the reading carpet for storytime and Michelle tells the class bird to come to participate , opening the cage and consequently resulting in the bird flying out the open window . A saddened Michelle tries desperately to get the bird back , but at the end of the episode , Danny gets her a new bird for her class . When she brings it in , all the kids love it , and Aaron lets Michelle wear the sharing crown for bringing the bird to be the class pet ; the two eventually become friends and stay friends throughout the series . </P> <P> In seasons five and six , she is friends with a boy named Teddy , whom she meets on her first day of kindergarten in the season five premiere `` Double Trouble '' . The two enjoy doing many things together ; it is revealed in `` The Long Goodbye '' that they enjoy dotting each other 's `` I '' 's on their papers . When the two are in first grade , Teddy reveals his father got a new job and thus he and his family have to move to Amarillo , Texas . Michelle , saddened by the news , ties him up in her room tricking him into thinking she was teaching him how to jump rope . He is eventually untied by Joey and he gives her his special toy , `` Furry Murray '' and she gives him her special stuffed pig , `` Pinky . '' Later , the two decide to write to one another . At the end of that same episode , Michelle makes a new friend named Denise Frazier , who then sits in Teddy 's old seat and learns how to cross `` T '' 's . The two become friends through the seventh season ( Denise does not appear in season eight due to her portrayer Jurnee Smollett 's commitment to the short - lived sitcom On Our Own ) . She , at first , does not want a new best friend , but she does like Denise . Michelle also makes many other friends throughout the series , including shy but intelligent Derek Boyd ( Blake McIver Ewing ) and tough - girl Lisa Leeper ( Kathryn Zaremba ) . </P> <P> In the season seven episode `` Be Your Own Best Friend , '' Teddy moves back to San Francisco and attends Michelle 's school once again , rejoining her class . Michelle , Teddy , and Denise get into an argument when Danny comes into class for Parent Volunteer Day . He gives an assignment to trace each student 's best friend , leading Michelle to believe that a person could only have one best friend . The three then have trouble deciding who to trace , allowing Michelle to take advantage of the situation . She says that she would pick the one who gives her the best stuff , but she did not say it explicitly ( Teddy offers to give her his lone - star bolo tie and some Snickles candy -- a parody of Skittles , and Denise offers her hair scrunchie and pencil case ; Michelle takes them up on the offers , not realizing she is accepting bribes , which ultimately make Teddy and Denise angry when they understand what is actually happening ) . The three eventually make up in the end after Michelle picks Comet the dog as her best friend and traces him , and Danny helps them to understand that they could all be best friends . </P> <H2> Comet the dog ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the season three episode `` And They Call It Puppy Love , '' the Tanner family adopts a dog named Comet , one of the puppies born to Minnie , a golden retriever who wandered from the home of her owners halfway across the country to California and was found by D.J. and Stephanie . Michelle grows a strong bond with Comet over the course of the series . In the season four episode `` One Last Kiss , '' Michelle wanted another dog that was her size because Comet got bigger . In the season six episode `` Road to Tokyo , '' when Jesse is on tour in Tokyo , Michelle decides to dig a hole to Tokyo in order to visit and she asks Comet to dig . In the season eight episode `` Comet 's Excellent Adventure , '' Comet runs away when Jesse unknowingly gives her permission to walk Comet by herself ( as he was trying to deal with his bandmates in Jesse and the Rippers voting him out of the group due to the intrusion of his commitments to the family and his radio show gig ) , leading Michelle ( and eventually , the rest of the family ) to look all around San Francisco to find him ( it was the only episode of the series that was filmed on location in San Francisco ) . Comet comes home at the end of the episode . </P> <H2> Crediting ( edit ) </H2> <P> The production team behind Full House did not want people to know that Michelle was played by a set of twins , so the girls were credited as `` Mary - Kate Ashley Olsen '' for most of the show 's run ( making it appear as if a single actress had the first name Mary - Kate and the middle name Ashley ) . Although the two were credited separately as `` Mary - Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen '' during the closing credits in the series ' first season ( they were not officially added to the opening title sequence until season two but were credited in the syndicated versions of the season one opening titles ) , it was not until the eighth and final season that the twins were credited as `` Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen '' in the opening titles . Despite the fact that the Olsens are fraternal twins , their physical appearances were nonetheless similar enough so that few could tell the difference between the two over the course of the show 's run . In season one , Mary - Kate was used more often due to the fact Ashley cried when she was put on set for a scene . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1989 , Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen won a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor / Actress Under Five Years of Age for their portrayal of Michelle . In 1990 , they were also awarded Young Artist Awards for their work on Full House , in the category of Outstanding Performance by an Actress Under Nine Years of Age . The two also won the Young Artist Awards for Exceptional Performance by a Young Actress Under Ten in 1991 . </P> <H2> Book series ( edit ) </H2> <P> Shortly after the show ended , two separate book series focusing respectively on Michelle and Stephanie were published . The stories take place mainly during the continuity of the show 's later seasons , and include the sisters ' friends and many other characters . The plots mainly focus on the characters ' struggles and triumphs . Most of the books were not an episode in the series . Michelle is about nine years old and Stephanie is in her teens in the series . The books were mainly published in the 1990s . </P> <H2> Fuller House ( edit ) </H2> <P> The twins declined to reprise their role for Fuller House , the 2016 Netflix sequel to Full House . Ashley cited their 12 years away from acting and Mary - Kate said the timing was bad . In the series , their character is only seen during flashbacks and mentioned from time - to - time . For example , they mention that Michelle is now working as a fashion designer in New York . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ TV.com . `` Full House : Comet 's Excellent Adventure - Season 8 , Episode 1 '' .

They are specialized smooth muscle cells mainly in the walls of the afferent arterioles , and some in the efferent arterioles , that deliver blood to the glomerulus . In synthesizing renin , they play a critical role in the renin - angiotensin system and thus in autoregulation of the kidney . </P> <P> Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to a drop in pressure detected by stretch receptors in the vascular walls , or when stimulated by macula densa cells . Macula densa cells are located in the distal convoluted tubule , and stimulate juxtaglomerular cells to release renin when they detect a drop in sodium concentration in tubular fluid . Together , juxtaglomerular cells , extraglomerular mesangial cells and macula densa cells comprise the juxtaglomerular complex . </P> <P> In appropriately stained tissue sections , juxtaglomerular cells are distinguished by their granulated cytoplasm . </P> <P> The juxtaglomerular cell is a cell that is located near the glomerulus , hence its name . </P> <P> Similar to cardiac tissue , juxtaglomerular cells harbor \u03b21 adrenergic receptors . When stimulated by epinephrine or norepinephrine , these receptors induce the secretion of renin .

Initially , nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup , but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings , and Indonesia 's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid . During the bidding process , the three remaining non-UEFA nations ( Australia , Japan , and the United States ) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids , and the UEFA nations were thus ruled out of the 2022 bid . As such , there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup : England , Russia , Netherlands / Belgium , and Portugal / Spain . </P> <P> The twenty - two - member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Z\u00fcrich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments . Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting . The Portugal / Spain bid came second , and that from Belgium / Netherlands third . England 's bid to host its second tournament fell at the first hurdle . </P> <P> The voting results were as follows : </P> <Table> 2018 FIFA bidding ( majority 12 votes ) <Tr> <Th> Bidders </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Votes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Round 1 </Th> <Th> Round 2 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Russia </Td> <Td> 9 </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Portugal / Spain </Td> <Td> 7 </Td> <Td> 7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium / Netherlands </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> England </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Eliminated </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Qualification </H2> Main article : 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification Team qualified for World Cup Team may qualify for World Cup Team failed to qualify - games to play Team failed to qualify for World Cup - all games done Team expelled from the tournament by FIFA prior to playing a match Country not a FIFA member <P> For the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup , all eligible nations - the 209 FIFA member associations minus automatically qualified hosts Russia - entered the qualifying process . Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches , while Gibraltar and Kosovo , who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun , also entered the competition . Myanmar , having successfully appealed against a ban from the competition for crowd trouble during a 2014 World Cup qualifying tie against Oman , were obliged to play all their home matches outside the country . </P> <P> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations , with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup . The first qualification game began in Dili , Timor Leste , on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC 's qualification , and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna , Saint Petersburg on 25 July 2015 at 18 : 00 local time ( UTC + 3 ) . </P> <H3> Qualified teams </H3> <P> As of 10 October 2017 , twenty - three countries have secured qualification to the final tournament . Of these , seventeen countries competed at the previous edition of the tournament in 2014 . Serbia will return to the tournament after missing the 2014 edition .

The format would have been the same , but in groups of five instead of four . This was in response to FIFA President Sepp Blatter 's comments that Africa and Asia deserved more spots in the World Cup finals at the expense of European and South American teams . However , FIFA general secretary J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke said that expansion in 2018 would be `` unlikely '' , while Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said that the country was `` preparing on the basis that 32 teams will be taking part . '' Expansion was ultimately delayed until 10 January 2017 , when the FIFA Council voted unanimously to expand to 48 teams starting in the 2026 FIFA World Cup . </P> <H2> Venues </H2> <P> Russia proposed the following host cities : Kaliningrad , Kazan , Krasnodar , Moscow , Nizhny Novgorod , Rostov - on - Don , Saint Petersburg , Samara , Saransk , Sochi , Volgograd , Yaroslavl , and Yekaterinburg . All the cities are in or just outside European Russia to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country . The bid evaluation report stated : `` The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums , thus exceeding FIFA 's minimum requirement . Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated , and 13 would be newly constructed . '' </P> <P> In October 2011 , Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14 . Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government , and also in the capital , Otkrytiye Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first . </P> <P> The final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012 . The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list . </P> <P> Sepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that due to concerns over the completion of venues in Russia , the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10 . He also said , `` We are not going to be in a situation , as is the case of one , two or even three stadiums in South Africa , where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums '' . </P> <P> In October 2014 , on their first official visit to Russia , FIFA 's inspection committee and its head Chris Unger visited St Petersburg , Sochi , Kazan and both Moscow venues . They were satisfied with the progress . </P> <P> On 8 October 2015 , FIFA and the Local Organising Committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums used during the tournament . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Moscow </Th> <Th> Saint Petersburg </Th> <Th> Kaliningrad </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Luzhniki Stadium </Td> <Td> Otkrytiye Arena ( Spartak Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Krestovsky Stadium ( Saint Petersburg Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Kaliningrad Stadium </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Capacity : 81,000 ( upgraded ) </Td> <Td> Capacity : 45,360 </Td> <Td> Capacity : 68,134 </Td> <Td> Capacity : 35,212 ( new stadium ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Kazan </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Moscow Saint Petersburg Kaliningrad Nizhny Novgorod Kazan Samara Volgograd Saransk Sochi Rostov - on - Don Yekaterinburg </Th> <Th> Nizhny Novgorod </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Kazan Arena </Td> <Td> Nizhny Novgorod Stadium </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Capacity : 45,379 </Td> <Td> Capacity : 44,899 ( new stadium ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Samara </Th> <Th> Volgograd </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Cosmos Arena ( Samara Arena ) </Td> <Td> Volgograd Arena </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Capacity : 44,918 ( new stadium ) </Td> <Td> Capacity : 45,568 ( rebuilt ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Saransk </Th> <Th> Rostov - on - Don </Th> <Th> Sochi </Th> <Th> Yekaterinburg </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mordovia Arena </Td> <Td> Rostov Arena </Td> <Td> Fisht Olympic Stadium ( Fisht Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Central Stadium ( Ekaterinburg Arena ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Capacity : 45,015 ( new stadium ) </Td> <Td> Capacity : 45,000 ( new stadium ) </Td> <Td> Capacity : 47,659 </Td> <Td> Capacity : 35,696 ( upgraded ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Media related to Stadiums of FIFA World Cup 2018 at Wikimedia Commons </P> <H2> Schedule </H2> A ceremony in Moscow launching the countdown from 1000 days until the 2018 FIFA Football World Cup begins in Russia . <P> The full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 ( without kick - off times , which were confirmed later ) . Russia will be placed in position A1 in the group stage and play in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June , which will also host the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July .

The 32 teams will be drawn into eight groups of four . </P> <P> For the draw , the teams will be allocated to four pots based on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017 . Pot 1 will contain the hosts Russia ( which will be automatically assigned to Position A1 ) and the best seven teams , Pot 2 will contain the next best eight teams , and so on for Pots 3 and 4 . This will be different from previous draws , where only Pot 1 was based on FIFA Rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations . Same as previous editions , teams from the same confederation will not be drawn against each other for the group stage , except for UEFA where each group can contain up to two teams . </P> <H2> Squads </H2> Main article : 2018 FIFA World Cup squads <P> Each team must first name a preliminary squad of 30 players . From the preliminary squad , the team must name a final squad of 23 players ( three of whom must be goalkeepers ) by the FIFA deadline . Players in the final squad may be replaced due to serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team 's first match , where the replacement players do not need to be in the preliminary squad . </P> <P> For players named in the 30 - player preliminary squad , there is a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018 , except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May . </P> <H2> Group stage </H2> <P> The top two teams of each group advance to the round of 16 .

Controversial issues have included the level of racism in Russian football , and discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society . Russia 's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also caused calls for the tournament to be moved , particularly following the annexation of Crimea . FIFA President Sepp Blatter said : `` The World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work '' . </P> <P> Allegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups caused threats from England 's FA to boycott the tournament . FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia , a US attorney , to investigate and produce a report ( the Garcia Report ) on the corruption allegations . Although the report was never published , FIFA released a 42 - page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans - Joachim Eckert . Eckert 's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing , but was denounced by critics as a whitewash . Garcia criticised the summary as being `` materially incomplete '' with `` erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions '' , and appealed to FIFA 's Appeal Committee . The committee declined to hear his appeal , so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA 's conduct , citing a `` lack of leadership '' and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert . </P> <P> On 3 June 2015 , the FBI confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups . In an interview published on 7 June 2015 , Domenico Scala , the head of FIFA 's Audit And Compliance Committee , stated that `` should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes , then the awards could be cancelled '' . </P> <P> Due to the financial crisis in the Russian economy , the budget for the preparations was cut a few times . In June 2015 , a government decree cut the budget by $560 million , to a total of $11.8 billion . </P> <H2> Russian visa policy </H2> <P> The general visa policy of Russia will not apply to the World Cup participants and fans , who will be able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship . </P> <H2> Branding </H2> The typeface used for branding <P> The tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow 's Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme . Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the logo was inspired by `` Russia 's rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation '' , and FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the `` heart and soul '' of the country . For the branding , a typeface called Dusha ( from \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430 , Russian for soul ) was created by Portuguese design agency Brandia Central in 2014 . </P> <H2> Broadcasting rights </H2> See also : 2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights <P> FIFA , through several companies , sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters . </P> <P> In the United States , the 2018 World Cup will be the first men 's World Cup whose rights will be held by Fox Sports . The elimination of the U.S. national team in qualifying led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced ( particularly `` casual '' viewers interested in the U.S. team ) , especially noting how much Fox paid for the rights , and that U.S. games at the 2014 World Cup peaked at 16.5 million viewers . During a launch event prior to the elimination , Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity in the U.S. ; the network stated that it still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament . </P> <H2> Prize money </H2> <P> Prize money amounts were annnounced in October 2017 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Position </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Amount ( USD million ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Per team </Td> <Td> Total </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Champions </Td> <Td> 38 </Td> <Td> 38 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Runners - up </Td> <Td> 28 </Td> <Td> 28 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Third place </Td> <Td> 24 </Td> <Td> 24 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Fourth place </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5th -- 8th place </Td> <Td> 16 </Td> <Td> 64 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 9th -- 16th place </Td> <Td> 12 </Td> <Td> 96 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 17th -- 32nd place </Td> <Td> 8 </Td> <Td> 128 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Total </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 400 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Mascot </H2> <P> The official FIFA World Cup mascot for the 2018 tournament , a wolf named Zabivaka ( `` the one who scores '' in Russian ) , was unveiled on 21 October 2016 . Representing an anthropomorphic wolf with brown and white wool T - shirt with the words `` RUSSIA 2018 '' and orange sport glasses . The combination of white , blue and red T - shirt and shorts are the national colors of the Russian team . The student designer is Ekaterina Bocharova , and the mascot was selected by Internet voting . </P> <P> The election results were announced on October 22 , 2016 , in the Evening Urgant on Channel One Russia . Wolf , named Zabivaka , scored 53 % of the vote , ahead of Tiger ( 27 % ) . Cat , with 20 % of the vote , was third . More than 1 million people participated in the voting , which took place during September 2016 on the FIFA platforms , as well as during the live broadcast on Channel One , where the results of the creative competition were announced . </P> <H2> Ticketing </H2> <P> The first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017 , 12 : 00 Moscow time , and will last until 12 October 2017 . </P> <H2> Sponsorship </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> FIFA partners </Th> <Th> FIFA World Cup sponsors </Th> <Th> European supporters </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Adidas </Li> <Li> Coca - Cola </Li> <Li> Gazprom </Li> <Li> Hyundai -- Kia </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Qatar Airways </Li> <Li> VISA </Li> <Li> Wanda Group </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Anheuser - Busch InBev </Li> <Li> Hisense </Li> <Li> McDonald 's </Li> <Li> Vivo </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Alfa - Bank </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Association football portal </Li> <Li> Russia portal </Li> <Li> 2010s portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup </Li> <Li> 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification ( CONMEBOL ) </Li> <Li> 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification ( CONCACAF ) </Li> <Li> 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification ( AFC ) </Li> <Li> 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification ( UEFA ) </Li> <Li> 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification ( CAF ) </Li> <Li> 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification ( OFC ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Standard Russian pronunciation is ( t\u0255\u026amjpj\u026a\u0250\u02c8nat \u02c8mjir\u0259 p\u0259 f\u028ad\u02c8bo\u026b\u028a djvj\u026a \u02c8t\u0268sj\u026at\u0255\u026a v\u0259sj\u026am\u02c8nats\u0259tj ) </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Ethics : Executive Committee unanimously supports recommendation to publish report on 2018 / 2022 FIFA World Cup TM bidding process '' ( Press release ) .
