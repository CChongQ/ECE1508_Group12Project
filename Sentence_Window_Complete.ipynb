The first three series were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995 , followed by a series finale in the form of a two - part television film entitled The Last Shout in 1996 .  Creator Jennifer Saunders revived the show for a fourth series in 2001 , after having written and submitted a pilot entitled Mirrorball , which recruited nearly all of the original cast in new roles .  The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes .  However , Saunders felt the characters were far too rich and interesting to put aside , and were far better suited for her new story ideas .  Instead of Mirrorball , a new series of Absolutely Fabulous was proposed to the BBC , which later commissioned the fourth series in 2001 . \n","No. 7 Source Node: At the end of the episode `` Birthday '' , Edina and Patsy sang the song together using a karaoke machine .

For series four , a line sung by David Bowie , `` Ziggy played guitar '' , from the song `` Ziggy Stardust '' played at the end of each episode .      Due to copyright issues , the theme song is missing from many of the US Region 1 DVDs , being replaced by an instrumental version of the song .  Also excised from the US DVD release is the musical number from Chicago performed by Horrocks , Gaffney , and Ryan , during a dream sequence in the series 5 episode `` Birthin ' '' .      In addition to the official theme song , in 1994 , Pet Shop Boys recorded a song for Comic Relief using excerpts of dialogue from the series put to dance music .

Pharyngeal arches are characteristic features of vertebrates whose origin can be traced back through chordates to basal deuterostomes who also share endodermal outpocketings of the pharyngeal apparatus .  Similar patterns of gene expression can be detected in the developing pharynx of amphioxus and hemichordates .  However , the vertebrate pharynx is unique in that it gives rise to endoskeletal support through the contribution of neural crest cells .      Pharyngeal jaws are a `` second set '' of jaws contained within the pharynx of many species of fish , distinct from the primary ( oral ) jaws .  Pharyngeal jaws have been studied in moray eels where their specific action is noted .  When the moray bites prey , it first bites normally with its oral jaws , capturing the prey . \n","No. 3 Source Node: The pharynx is an area found in vertebrates and invertebrates , though the structure is not universally the same across all of those species .

The pharynx arises during development in all vertebrates through a series of six or more outpocketings on the lateral sides of the head .  These outpocketings are pharyngeal arches , and they give rise to a number of different structures in the skeletal , muscular and circulatory systems .  The structure of the pharynx varies across the vertebrates .  It differs in dogs , horses and ruminants .  In dogs a single duct connects the nasopharynx to the nasal cavity .

The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety , but two - thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed .  He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea , but the tide kept floating them back together into groups , some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds .

Meanwhile , the royal court at Versailles was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis .  While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch , in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition .  While he did reduce government expenditures , opponents in the parlements successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms .  The Enlightenment had produced many writers , pamphleteers and publishers who could inform or inflame public opinion .  The opposition used this resource to mobilise public opinion against the monarchy , which in turn tried to repress the underground literature .

France was experiencing such a severe economic depression that there was n't enough food to go around .

For instance , he argues against the way in which poetry was misaligned with youth , the effeminate and the timorous .  He does so by introducing the idea that `` poetry is the companion of camps '' and by invoking the heroes of ages past .
