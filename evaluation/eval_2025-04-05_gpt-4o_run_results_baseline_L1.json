            "Theme song ( edit )     The theme song for Absolutely Fabulous is `` This Wheel 's on Fire '' , written by Bob Dylan and Rick Danko and performed by Julie Driscoll and Saunders ' husband Adrian Edmondson . The song was also sung by Marianne Faithfull and P.P. Arnold for the `` Last Shout '' special in 1996 . Hermine Demoriane sang a French version of the theme song over the closing credits of the episode `` Paris '' . At the end of the episode `` Birthday '' , Edina and Patsy sang the song together using a karaoke machine . More recently , it has been sung by Debbie Harry , who also guest - starred in the 2002 Christmas special `` Gay '' . For series four , a line sung by David Bowie , `` Ziggy played guitar '' , from the song `` Ziggy Stardust '' played at the end of each episode .     Due to copyright issues , the theme song is missing from many of the US Region 1 DVDs , being replaced by an instrumental version of the song . Also excised from the US DVD release is the musical number from Chicago performed by Horrocks , Gaffney , and Ryan , during a dream sequence in the series 5 episode `` Birthin ' '' .     In addition to the official theme song , in 1994 , Pet Shop Boys recorded a song for Comic Relief using excerpts of dialogue from the series put to dance music . The single was attributed to `` Absolutely Fabulous produced by Pet Shop Boys '' . It peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1994 . The music video featured clips from the show and specially recorded footage of the Pet Shop Boys with Patsy and Edina .     On 10 June 2016 , Kylie Minogue released her version of `` This Wheel 's on Fire '' for Absolutely Fabulous : The Movie , prior to the film 's release in July 2016 .",

It is based on a 1990 French & Saunders sketch created by Saunders and Dawn French .     The series features Saunders as Edina Monsoon , a heavy - drinking , drug - abusing PR agent who spends her time chasing bizarre fads in a desperate attempt to stay young and `` hip '' . Edina is joined in her quest by magazine fashion director Patsy Stone ( played by Joanna Lumley ) , her best friend and enabler , whose drug abuse , alcohol consumption , and promiscuity far eclipse Edina 's comparatively mild self - destructive behaviour . Despite being a middle - aged , twice - divorced career woman , Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter Saffron ( Julia Sawalha ) , a secondary school pupil ( and later university student ) whose constant care of her mother has left her a bitter cynic . The series also stars June Whitfield as Edina 's sarcastic and thieving mother , and Jane Horrocks as Edina 's brainless personal assistant .     Absolutely Fabulous returned for three special episodes which were originally broadcast on 25 December 2011 , 1 January 2012 and 23 July 2012 to mark the show 's 20th anniversary . The episode broadcast on 23 July 2012 featured the 2012 Summer Olympics which were being held in London that week . A film based on the series was released to theatres on 1 July 2016 . On 28 November 2016 , Jennifer Saunders announced that the series is finished ."

            "History ( edit )     Figure skating was first contested as an Olympic sport at the 1908 Summer Olympics , in London , United Kingdom . As this traditional winter sport could be conducted indoors , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) approved its inclusion in the Summer Olympics program . It was featured a second time at the Antwerp Games , after which it was permanently transferred to the program of the Winter Olympic Games , first held in 1924 in Chamonix , France .     In London , figure skating was presented in four events : men 's singles , women 's singles , men 's special figures , and mixed pairs . The special figures contest was won by Russian Nikolai Panin , who gave his country its first ever Olympic gold medal . He remains the event 's sole winner , as it was subsequently dropped from the program .     Ice dance joined as a medal sport in 1976 , after appearing as a demonstration event at Grenoble 1968 .     A team event debuted at the 2014 Olympics . It consists of two segments : qualification and finals . During qualification each team has one men 's single skater , one ladies ' single skater , one pair , and one ice dance couple skate their short program / dance . Before the finals , each team is allowed to replace up to two skaters / couples . The final consists of each skater / couple skating their short program / dance .

            "Recording history ( edit )     Forsey asked Cy Curnin from The Fixx , Bryan Ferry and Billy Idol to record the song , but all three declined ; Idol did later perform a cover of it on his 2001 compilation album Greatest Hits . Schiff then suggested Forsey ask Simple Minds who , after refusing as well , agreed under the encouragement of their label , A&M . According to frontman Jim Kerr , the band was reluctant to record the song as they felt they should only record their own material , relenting after persuasion from Kerr 's wife at the time , Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders , and a phone call from Forsey in which he expressed his admiration for the band . According to one account , the band `` rearranged and recorded ' Do n't You ( Forget About Me ) ' in three hours in a north London studio and promptly forgot about it . ''     Continuing the rock direction recently taken on Sparkle in the Rain but also glancing back at their melodic synthpop past , it caught the band at their commercial peak and , propelled by the success of The Breakfast Club , became a # 1 hit in the U.S. and around the world . It is also the band 's only # 1 hit on the U.S. Top Rock Tracks chart , staying atop for three weeks . While only reaching # 7 in the UK , it stayed on the charts from 1985 to 1987 , one of the longest time spans for any single in the history of the chart .     The song did not appear on the band 's subsequent album Once Upon a Time , but it did appear on the 1992 best - of Glittering Prize 81 / 92 . It soon became a fixture of the band 's live sets - with an extended audience participation section during its inclusion on the 2015 tour to promote the band 's Big Music album .     Two versions were created for release . A short version , 4 : 23 in duration , appeared on the single and the original motion picture soundtrack album of The Breakfast Club . A longer version , 6 : 32 in duration , was released as a 12 '' single . This version contains longer breakdowns and drum fills , a second appearance of the bridge and a longer ending .     John Leland from Spin wrote that `` ' Do n't You Forget About Me , ' a romantic and melancholy dance track , therefore cuts ice both in the living room and on the dance floor . ''",

            "Bombardment   Bombardment of the Fort by the Confederates   At 4 : 30 a.m. on April 12 , 1861 , Lt. Henry S. Farley , acting upon the command of Capt . George S. James , fired a single 10 - inch mortar round from Fort Johnson . ( James had offered the first shot to Roger Pryor , a noted Virginia secessionist , who declined , saying , `` I could not fire the first gun of the war . '' ) The shell exploded over Fort Sumter as a signal to open the general bombardment from 43 guns and mortars at Fort Moultrie , Fort Johnson , the floating battery , and Cummings Point . Under orders from Beauregard , the guns fired in a counterclockwise sequence around the harbor , with 2 minutes between each shot ; Beauregard wanted to conserve ammunition , which he calculated would last for only 48 hours . Edmund Ruffin , another noted Virginia secessionist , had traveled to Charleston to be present for the beginning of the war , and fired one of the first shots at Sumter after the signal round , a 64 - pound shell from the Iron Battery at Cummings Point . The shelling of Fort Sumter from the batteries ringing the harbor awakened Charleston 's residents ( including diarist Mary Chesnut ) , who rushed out into the predawn darkness to watch the shells arc over the water and burst inside the fort .     Major Anderson held his fire , awaiting daylight . His troops reported for a call at 6 a.m. and then had breakfast . At 7 a.m. , Capt . Abner Doubleday fired a shot at the Ironclad Battery at Cummings Point . He missed . Given the available manpower , Anderson could not take advantage of all of his 60 guns . He deliberately avoided using guns that were situated in the fort where casualties were most likely . The fort 's best cannons were mounted on the uppermost of its three tiers -- the barbette tier -- where his troops were most exposed to incoming fire from overhead . The fort had been designed to withstand a naval assault , and naval warships of the time did not mount guns capable of elevating to shoot over the walls of the fort . However , the land - based cannons manned by the Confederates were capable of high - arcing ballistic trajectories and could therefore fire at parts of the fort that would have been out of naval guns ' reach . Fort Sumter 's garrison could only safely fire the 21 working guns on the lowest level , which themselves , because of the limited elevation allowed by their embrasures , were largely incapable of delivering fire with trajectories high enough to seriously threaten Fort Moultrie . Moreover , although the Federals had moved as many of their supplies to Fort Sumter as they could manage , the fort was quite low on ammunition , and was nearly out at the end of the 34 - hour bombardment . A more immediate problem was the scarcity of cloth gunpowder cartridges or bags ; only 700 were available at the beginning of the battle and workmen sewed frantically to create more , in some cases using socks from Anderson 's personal wardrobe . Because of the shortages , Anderson reduced his firing to only six guns : two aimed at Cummings Point , two at Fort Moultrie , and two at the Sullivan 's Island batteries .     Ships from Fox 's relief expedition began to arrive on April 12 . Although Fox himself arrived at 3 a.m. on his steamer Baltic , most of the rest of his fleet was delayed until 6 p.m. , and one of the two warships , USS Powhatan , never did arrive . Unbeknownst to Fox , it had been ordered to the relief of Fort Pickens in Florida . As landing craft were sent toward the fort with supplies , the artillery fire deterred them and they pulled back . Fox decided to wait until after dark and for the arrival of his warships . The next day , heavy seas made it difficult to load the small boats with men and supplies and Fox was left with the hope that Anderson and his men could hold out until dark on April 13 .     Although Sumter was a masonry fort , there were wooden buildings inside for barracks and officer quarters . The",
            "Aftermath     The bombardment of Fort Sumter was the first military action of the American Civil War . Following the surrender , Northerners rallied behind Lincoln 's call for all states to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union . With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far , Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days . Some Northern states filled their quotas quickly . There were so many volunteers in Ohio that within 16 days they could have met the full call for 75,000 men by themselves . Other governors from border states were undiplomatic in their responses . For example , Gov. Claiborne Jackson wrote , `` Not one man will the state of Missouri furnish to carry on any such unholy crusade '' , and Gov. Beriah Magoffin wrote , `` Kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern states . '' The governors of other states still in the Union were equally unsupportive . The call for 75,000 troops triggered four additional slave states to declare their secession from the Union and join the Confederacy . The ensuing war lasted four years , effectively ending in April 1865 with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia at Appomatox Courthouse .     Charleston Harbor was completely in Confederate hands for almost the entire four - year duration of the war , leaving a hole in the Union naval blockade . Union forces conducted major operations in 1862 and 1863 to capture Charleston , first overland on James Island ( the Battle of Secessionville , June 1862 ) , then by naval assault against Fort Sumter ( the First Battle of Charleston Harbor , April 1863 ) , then by seizing the Confederate artillery positions on Morris Island ( beginning with the Second Battle of Fort Wagner , July 1863 , and followed by a siege until September ) . After pounding Sumter to rubble with artillery fire , a final amphibious operation attempted to occupy it ( the Second Battle of Fort Sumter , September 1863 ) , but was repulsed and no further attempts were made . The Confederates evacuated Fort Sumter and Charleston in February 1865 as Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman outflanked the city in the Carolinas Campaign . On April 14 , 1865 , four years to the day after lowering the Fort Sumter Flag in surrender , Robert Anderson ( by then a major general , although ill and in retired status ) returned to the ruined fort to raise the flag he had lowered in 1861 .     Two of the cannons used at Fort Sumter were later presented to Louisiana State University by General William Tecumseh Sherman , who was president of the university before the war began ."

        "input_question": "when is the second sound of the heartbeat produced",
        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "The second heart sound , or S , forms the `` dub '' of `` lub - dub '' and is composed of components A ( aortic valve closure ) and P ( pulmonary valve closure ) . Normally A precedes P especially during inspiration where a split of S can be heard . It is caused by the closure of the semilunar valves ( the aortic valve and pulmonary valve ) at the end of ventricular systole and the beginning of ventricular diastole . As the left ventricle empties , its pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta . Aortic blood flow quickly reverses back toward the left ventricle , catching the pocket - like cusps of the aortic valve , and is stopped by aortic valve closure . Similarly , as the pressure in the right ventricle falls below the pressure in the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary valve closes . The S sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal .     Splitting of S2 , also known as physiological split , normally occurs during inhalation because the decrease in intrathoracic pressure increases the time needed for pulmonary pressure to exceed that of the right ventricular pressure . A widely split S2 can be associated with several different cardiovascular conditions , including left bundle branch block , pulmonary stenosis , and atrial septal defect .",
            "Main article : Third heart sound   Rarely , there may be a third heart sound also called a protodiastolic gallop , ventricular gallop , or informally the `` Kentucky '' gallop as an onomatopoeic reference to the rhythm and stress of S1 followed by S2 and S3 together ( S1 = Ken ; S2 = tuck ; S3 = y ) .     `` lub - dub - ta '' or `` slosh - ing - in '' If new , indicates heart failure or volume overload .     It occurs at the beginning of diastole after S2 and is lower in pitch than S1 or S2 as it is not of valvular origin . The third heart sound is benign in youth , some trained athletes , and sometimes in pregnancy but if it re-emerges later in life it may signal cardiac problems , such as a failing left ventricle as in dilated congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . S3 is thought to be caused by the oscillation of blood back and forth between the walls of the ventricles initiated by blood rushing in from the atria . The reason the third heart sound does not occur until the middle third of diastole is probably that during the early part of diastole , the ventricles are not filled sufficiently to create enough tension for reverberation .     It may also be a result of tensing of the chordae tendineae during rapid filling and expansion of the ventricle . In other words , an S3 heart sound indicates increased volume of blood within the ventricle . An S3 heart sound is best heard with the bell - side of the stethoscope ( used for lower frequency sounds ) . A left - sided S3 is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position and at the apex of the heart , which is normally located in the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line . A right - sided S3 is best heard at the lower - left sternal border . The way to distinguish between a left and right - sided S3 is to observe whether it increases in intensity with inhalation or exhalation . A right - sided S3 will increase on inhalation , while a left - sided S3 will increase on exhalation .     S3 can be a normal finding in young patients but is generally pathologic over the age of 40 . The most common cause of pathologic S3 is congestive heart failure ."

Partly a function of this and past instability , Argentines have historically held more deposits overseas than domestically . The estimated US $173 billion in overseas accounts and investment exceeded the domestic monetary base ( M3 ) by nearly US $10 billion in 2012 .   Tourism ( edit ) Main article : Tourism in Argentina Tour bus in Buenos Aires .   According to World Economic Forum 's 2017 Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report , tourism generated over US $22 billion , or 3.9 % of GDP , and the industry employed more than 671,000 people , or approximately 3.7 % of the total workforce . Tourism from abroad contributed US $5.3 billion , having become the third largest source of foreign exchange in 2004 . Around 5.7 million foreign visitors arrived in 2017 , reflecting a doubling in visitors since 2002 despite a relative appreciation of the peso .     Argentines , who have long been active travelers within their own country , accounted for over 80 % , and international tourism has also seen healthy growth ( nearly doubling since 2001 ) . Stagnant for over two decades , domestic travel increased strongly in the last few years , and visitors are flocking to a country seen as affordable , exceptionally diverse , and safe .     Foreign tourism , both to and from Argentina , is increasing as well . INDEC recorded 5.2 million foreign tourist arrivals and 6.7 million departures in 2013 ; of these , 32 % arrived from Brazil , 19 % from Europe , 10 % from the United States and Canada , 10 % from Chile , 24 % from the rest of the Western Hemisphere , and 5 % from the rest of the world . Around 48 % of visitors arrived by commercial flight , 40 % by motor travel ( mainly from neighboring Brazil ) , and 12 % by sea . Cruise liner arrivals are the fastest growing type of foreign tourism to Argentina ; a total of 160 liners carrying 510,000 passengers arrived at the Port of Buenos Aires in 2013 , an eightfold increase in a just a decade .",

            "departments in one way or another opposed the central Paris government , and in many cases ' Girondins ' , fled from Paris after 2 June , led those revolts . In Brittany 's countryside , the people rejecting the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 had taken to a guerrilla warfare known as Chouannerie . But generally , the French opposition against ' Paris ' had now evolved into a plain struggle for power over the country against the ' Montagnards ' around Robespierre and Marat now dominating Paris .     In June -- July 1793 , Bordeaux , Marseilles , Brittany , Caen and the rest of Normandy gathered armies to march on Paris and against ' the revolution ' . In July , Lyon guillotined the deposed ' Montagnard ' head of the city council . Barère , member of the Committee of Public Prosperity , on 1 August incited the Convention to tougher measures against the Vendée , at war with Paris since March : `` We 'll have peace only when no Vendée remains ... we 'll have to exterminate that rebellious people '' . In August , Convention troops besieged Lyon .     On 17 August 1793 , the Convention voted for general conscription , the levée en masse , which mobilised all citizens to serve as soldiers or suppliers in the war effort . The consecutive successes in the French revolutionary wars earned Lazare Carnot the title ' Organizer of Victory ' .     In August -- September 1793 , militants urged the Convention to do more to quell the counter-revolution . A delegation of the Commune ( Paris city council ) suggested to form revolutionary armies to arrest hoarders and conspirators . Barère , member of the Committee of Public Prosperity -- the de facto executive government -- ever since April 1793 , among others on 5 September reacted favorably , saying : let 's `` make terror the order of the day ! '' The National Convention on 9 September voted to establish sans - culottes paramilitary forces , revolutionary armies , and to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government . On 17 September , the Law of Suspects was passed , which ordered the arrest of suspected counter-revolutionaries and people who had revealed themselves as `` enemies of freedom '' . This decree was one of the causes for some 17,000 legal death sentences until the end of July 1794 , an average of 370 per week -- reason for historians to label those 101⁄2 months ' the ( Reign of ) Terror ' .     On 19 September the Vendée rebels again defeated a Republican Convention army . On 29 September , the Convention extended price limits from grain and bread to other household goods and established the Law of the Maximum , intended to prevent price gouging and supply food to the cities .     On 1 October Barère repeated his plea to subdue the Vendée : `` refuge of fanaticism , where priests have raised their altars ... '' . In October the Convention troops captured Lyon and reinstated a Montagnard government there .     Criteria for bringing someone before the Revolutionary Tribunal , created March 1793 , had always been vast and vague . By August , political disagreement seemed enough to be summoned before the Tribunal ; appeal against a Tribunal verdict was impossible . Late August 1793 , an army general had been guillotined on the accusation of choosing too timid strategies on the battlefield . Mid-October , the widowed former queen Marie Antoinette was on trial for a long list of charges such as `` teaching ( her husband ) Louis Capet the art of dissimulation '' and incest with her son , she too was guillotined . In October 1793 , 21 former ' Girondins ' Convention members who had n't left Paris after June were convicted to death and executed , on the charge of verbally supporting the preparation of an insurrection in Caen by fellow - Girondins .

            "10,000 troops and millions of dollars to the rebels . Despite succeeding in gaining independence for the Thirteen Colonies , France was severely indebted by the American Revolutionary War . France 's inefficient and antiquated financial system could not finance this debt . Faced with a financial crisis , the king called an Estates General , recommended by the Assembly of Notables in 1787 for the first time in over a century .     France was experiencing such a severe economic depression that there was n't enough food to go around . As with most monarchies , the upper class was always insured a stable living so while the rich remained very wealthy , the majority of the French population was starving . Many were so destitute that they could n't even feed their families and resorted to theft or prostitution to stay alive . Meanwhile , the royal court at Versailles was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis . While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch , in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition . While he did reduce government expenditures , opponents in the parlements successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms . The Enlightenment had produced many writers , pamphleteers and publishers who could inform or inflame public opinion . The opposition used this resource to mobilise public opinion against the monarchy , which in turn tried to repress the underground literature .     Many other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals . These included resentment of royal absolutism ; resentment by peasants , labourers and the bourgeoisie towards the traditional seigneurial privileges possessed by the nobility ; resentment of the Catholic Church 's influence over public policy and institutions ; aspirations for freedom of religion ; resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy ; aspirations for social , political and economic equality , and ( especially as the Revolution progressed ) republicanism ; hatred of Queen Marie - Antoinette , who was falsely accused of being a spendthrift and an Austrian spy ; and anger towards the King for dismissing ministers , including finance minister Jacques Necker , who were popularly seen as representatives of the people .     Freemasonry played an important role in the revolution . Originally largely apolitical , Freemasonry was radicalised in the late 18th century through the introduction of higher grades which emphasised themes of liberty , equality , and fraternity . Virtually every major player in the Revolution was a Freemason and these themes became the widely recognised slogan of the revolution ."

The Revolution overthrew the monarchy , established a republic , experienced violent periods of political turmoil , and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond . Inspired by liberal and radical ideas , the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history , triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies . Through the Revolutionary Wars , it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East . Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history .",

            "Original release ( edit )     Berry Gordy wrote `` Do You Love Me '' with the intention that The Temptations , who had no Top 40 hits to their name yet , would record it . However , when Gordy wanted to locate the group and record the song , they were nowhere to be found ( the Temptations had not been made aware of Gordy 's intentions , and had departed Motown 's Hitsville USA recording studio for a local Detroit gospel music showcase ) .     After spending some time looking for the Temptations , Gordy ran into the Contours ( Billy Gordon , Hubert Johnson , Billy Hoggs , Joe Billingslea , Sylvester Potts , and guitarist Hugh Davis ) in the hallway . Wanting to record and release `` Do You Love Me '' as soon as possible , Gordy decided to let them record his `` sure - fire hit '' instead of the Temptations . The Contours , who were in danger of being dropped from the label after their first two singles ( `` Whole Lotta ' Woman '' and `` The Stretch '' ) failed to chart , were so elated at Gordy 's offer that they immediately began hugging and thanking him .     `` Do You Love Me , '' the fifth release on Gordy Records , became a notably successful dance record , built around Gordon 's screaming vocals . Selling over a million copies , `` Do You Love Me '' peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks starting on October 20 , 1962 , and was a number - one hit on the Billboard R&B Singles chart . An album featuring the single , Do You Love Me ( Now That I Can Dance ) , was also released .

        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "Energy generation ( edit )   Logarithm of the relative energy output ( ε ) Proton - Proton ( PP ) , CNO and Triple - α fusion processes at different temperatures : The dashed line shows the combined energy generation of the PP and CNO processes within a star . At the Sun 's core temperature , the PP process is more efficient . See also : Stellar nucleosynthesis   All main - sequence stars have a core region where energy is generated by nuclear fusion . The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support the remainder of the star . A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core , resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure . Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand , lowering the pressure at the core . Thus the star forms a self - regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime .     Main - sequence stars employ two types of hydrogen fusion processes , and the rate of energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region . Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts , based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process . In the lower main sequence , energy is primarily generated as the result of the proton - proton chain , which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium . Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle . ( See the chart . ) This process uses atoms of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium .     At a stellar core temperature of 18 million Kelvin , the PP process and CNO cycle are equally efficient , and each type generates half of the star 's net luminosity . As this is the core temperature of a star with about 1.5 M , the upper main sequence consists of stars above this mass . Thus , roughly speaking , stars of spectral class F or cooler belong to the lower main sequence , while A-type stars or hotter are upper main - sequence stars . The transition in primary energy production from one form to the other spans a range difference of less than a single solar mass . In the Sun , a one solar - mass star , only 1.5 % of the energy is generated by the CNO cycle . By contrast , stars with 1.8 M or above generate almost their entire energy output through the CNO cycle .     The observed upper limit for a main - sequence star is 120 -- 200 M . The theoretical explanation for this limit is that stars above this mass can not radiate energy fast enough to remain stable , so any additional mass will be ejected in a series of pulsations until the star reaches a stable limit . The lower limit for sustained proton -- proton nuclear fusion is about 0.08 M or 80 times the mass of Jupiter . Below this threshold are sub-stellar objects that can not sustain hydrogen fusion , known as brown dwarfs .",
            "Lifetime ( edit )   This plot gives an example of the mass - luminosity relationship for zero - age main - sequence stars . The mass and luminosity are relative to the present - day Sun .   The total amount of energy that a star can generate through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is limited by the amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core . For a star in equilibrium , the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface . Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time , the total life span can be estimated , to first approximation , as the total energy produced divided by the star 's luminosity .     For a star with at least 0.5 M , when the hydrogen supply in its core is exhausted and it expands to become a red giant , it can start to fuse helium atoms to form carbon . The energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process , and the luminosity of the star increases . This results in a much shorter length of time in this stage compared to the main sequence lifetime . ( For example , the Sun is predicted to spend 130 million years burning helium , compared to about 12 billion years burning hydrogen . ) Thus , about 90 % of the observed stars above 0.5 M will be on the main sequence . On average , main - sequence stars are known to follow an empirical mass - luminosity relationship . The luminosity ( L ) of the star is roughly proportional to the total mass ( M ) as the following power law :       L ∝ M 3.5 ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ begin ( smallmatrix ) L \\ \\ propto \\ M ^ ( 3.5 ) \\ end ( smallmatrix ) ) )       This relationship applies to main - sequence stars in the range 0.1 -- 50 M .     The amount of fuel available for nuclear fusion is proportional to the mass of the star . Thus , the lifetime of a star on the main sequence can be estimated by comparing it to solar evolutionary models . The Sun has been a main - sequence star for about 4.5 billion years and it will become a red giant in 6.5 billion years , for a total main sequence lifetime of roughly 10 years . Hence :       τ M S ≈ 10 10 years ⋅ ( M M ⨀ ) ⋅ ( L ⨀ L ) = 10 10 years ⋅ ( M M ⨀ ) − 2.5 ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ begin ( smallmatrix ) \\ tau _ ( \\ rm ( MS ) ) \\ \\ approx \\ 10 ^ ( 10 ) ( \\ text ( years ) ) \\ cdot \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( M ) ( M_ ( \\ bigodot ) ) ) \\ right ) \\ cdot \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( L_ ( \\ bigodot ) ) ( L ) ) \\ right ) \\ =\\ 10 ^ ( 10 ) ( \\ text ( years ) ) \\ cdot \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( M ) ( M_ ( \\ bigodot ) ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( - 2.5 ) \\ end ( smallmatrix ) ) )       where M and L are the mass and luminosity of the star , respectively , M ⨀ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ begin ( smallmatrix ) M_ ( \\ bigodot ) \\ end ( smallmatrix ) ) ) is a solar mass , L ⨀ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ begin ( smallmatrix ) L_ ( \\ bigodot ) \\ end ( smallmatrix ) ) ) is the solar luminosity and τ M S ( \\ displaystyle \\ tau _ ( \\ rm ( MS ) ) ) is the star 's estimated main sequence lifetime .     Although more massive stars have more fuel to burn and might intuitively be expected to last longer , they also radiate a proportionately greater amount with increased mass . This is required by the stellar equation of state ; for a massive star to maintain equilibrium , the outward pressure of radiated energy generated in the core not only must but will rise to match the titanic inward gravitational pressure of its envelope . Thus , the most massive stars may remain on the main sequence for only a few million years , while stars with less than a tenth of a solar mass may last for over a trillion years .     The exact mass - luminosity relationship depends on how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface . A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core , so the star does not need to produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium . By contrast , a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and"

The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance .

Following this launch , and prior to Expedition 1 , there were five manned Space Shuttle flights and two unmanned Russian flights to the ISS . Some of these flights delivered large modules , such as the pressurized Unity and Zvezda modules , and the first piece of the Integrated Truss Structure . The manned flights were used for partial assembly of the ISS , as well as to start unpacking the supplies and equipment that were being delivered . Prior to Expedition 1 , Krikalev expected the ISS to be very similar to his experience on Mir ten years previous , due to the physical similarities of the stations ' components .     The launch of the Expedition 1 crew occurred a week before the United States presidential election , so it got little attention in the United States . At the time of the mission , the station was expected to be completed in 2006 , and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015 .

Worldwide , he is best known for physically portraying Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy ( with the character 's voice being performed by James Earl Jones ) , and in 2015 starred in a documentary concerning that role , entitled I Am Your Father .

            "stole the lightsaber he used in the Star Wars trilogy and several of his other possessions . However , after a discussion with Prowse on 4 May 2007 , he said that the `` lightsaber '' was actually a toy and not an original prop . He explained that the story printed about the break - in concentrated on the supposed `` lightsaber '' and not on the jewellery and other valuables taken . He further said that he was never given any of the props from the Star Wars films .     Since 2002 Prowse has been an Honorary Member / Honorary Leader of the 501st Legion , a fan group dedicated to Star Wars costuming .     Prowse continues to associate himself with his role in the Star Wars films and is involved in the convention circuit . Despite this , he has not been included in recent reunions of the original cast , such as those for the Empire of Dreams documentary and the 2005 Vanity Fair cover . While being interviewed by Kevin Moore of The Moore Show Prime Time , he admitted his dislike for the prequel trilogy and opined that the new films were `` out of context in terms of special effects in comparison to the original trilogy '' .     In July 2007 , Prowse joined many others from the Star Wars films for the first ever Star Wars Celebration event held outside the United States . It was run by Lucasfilm Ltd. and the Cards Inc . Group , at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London . The occasion was to mark the 30th anniversary of Star Wars .     Prowse played a cameo role in the Star Wars fan films `` Order of the Sith : Vengeance '' and its sequel `` Downfall '' -- Order of the Sith , alongside Jeremy Bulloch and Michael Sheard . These fan films were made in Britain in support of the charity Save the Children .     In 2008 , he was one of the cast members featured on Justin Lee Collins 's Bring Back ... Star Wars . In the film , Prowse commented that he had a dispute with George Lucas after he allegedly leaked reports of Darth Vader 's death to the press . Prowse had previously suggested that Darth Vader could be Luke Skywalker 's father in a speech he gave to UC Berkeley in 1978 . However , this was shortly after the release of Star Wars and nearly two years before The Empire Strikes Back ( which he considers to be his favourite of the trilogy ) was released , and the script had not even been written at the time . Gary Kurtz , the producer of The Empire Strikes Back , said in the 2015 documentary I Am Your Father that Prowse 's apparent plot spoiler was simply `` a good guess . ''     Prowse claims his contract for Return of the Jedi included a share of profits on the film , and although it grossed $475 million on a $32 million budget , Prowse explained in an interview in 2009 that he has never received residuals for his performance . Due to `` Hollywood accounting '' , the actual profits are sent as `` distribution fees '' to the studio , leaving nothing to distribute to others .     In July 2010 , Prowse was banned by George Lucas from attending official Star Wars fan conventions . Lucas has reportedly given Prowse no reason , other than stating that Prowse `` burnt too many bridges '' between Lucasfilm and himself .     A 2015 Spanish documentary , by filmmaker Marcos Cabotá , entitled I Am Your Father , details Prowse 's current life and his blackballing by LucasFilm , which the documentary suggests is unjustified . The leaks featured in the documentary originated from a technician working on the films .   Dave Prowse & Jayce Lewis 2015"

        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "Bishop ( edit )   Main article : Bishop ( Catholic Church )   The bishops , who possess the fullness of orders , and therefore the fullness of both priesthood and diaconate , are as a body ( the College of Bishops ) considered the successors of the Apostles and are `` constituted Pastors in the Church , to be the teachers of doctrine , the priests of sacred worship and the ministers of governance '' and `` represent the Church . '' In the year 2012 , there were 5,133 Catholic bishops ; at the end of 2014 , there were 5,237 Catholic bishops . The Pope himself is a bishop ( the bishop of Rome ) and traditionally uses the title `` Venerable Brother '' when writing formally to another bishop .     The typical role of a bishop is to provide pastoral governance for a diocese . Bishops who fulfill this function are known as diocesan ordinaries , because they have what canon law calls ordinary ( i.e. not delegated ) authority for a diocese . These bishops may be known as hierarchs in the Eastern Catholic Churches . Other bishops may be appointed to assist ordinaries ( auxiliary bishops and coadjutor bishops ) or to carry out a function in a broader field of service to the Church , such as appointments as papal nuncios or as officials in the Roman Curia .     Bishops of a country or region may form an episcopal conference and meet periodically to discuss current problems . Decisions in certain fields , notably liturgy , fall within the exclusive competence of these conferences . The decisions of the conferences are binding on the individual bishops only if agreed to by at least two - thirds of the membership and confirmed by the Holy See .     Bishops are normally ordained to the episcopate by at least three other bishops , though for validity only one is needed and a mandatum from the Holy See is required . Ordination to the episcopate is considered the completion of the sacrament of Holy Orders ; even when a bishop retires from his active service , he remains a bishop , since the ontological effect of Holy Orders is permanent . On the other hand , titles such as archbishop or patriarch imply no ontological alteration , and existing bishops who rise to those offices do not require further ordination .     Sacramentally , all bishops are equal . According to jurisdiction , office , and privileges , however , various ranks are distinguished , as indicated below . All bishops are `` vicars of Christ '' .",
            "In general ( edit )     Bishops are assisted by priests and deacons . All priests and deacons are incardinated in a diocese or religious order . Parishes , whether territorial or person - based , within a diocese are normally in the charge of a priest , known as the parish priest or the pastor .     In the Latin Church , only celibate men , as a rule , are ordained as priests , while the Eastern Churches , again as a rule , ordain both celibate and married men . Among the Eastern particular Churches , the Ethiopic Catholic Church ordains only celibate clergy , while also having married priests who were ordained in the Orthodox Church , while other Eastern Catholic Churches , which do ordain married men , do not have married priests in certain countries . The Western or Latin Church does sometimes , though rarely , ordain married men , usually Protestant clergy who have become Catholics . All sui iuris Churches of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that , following ordination , marriage is not allowed . Even a married priest whose wife dies may not then marry again .     The Catholic Church and the ancient Christian Churches see priestly ordination as a sacrament dedicating the person ordained to a permanent relationship of service , and , like Baptism and Confirmation , having an ontological effect on the person . It is for this reason that a person may be ordained to each of the three orders only once . They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males ."

        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "Car nomenclature ( edit )     Until 1994 , Mercedes - Benz utilized an alphanumeric system for categorizing their vehicles , consisting of a number sequence approximately equal to the engine 's displacement in liters multiplied by 100 , followed by an arrangement of alphabetical suffixes , indicating body style and engine type .       `` C '' indicates a coupe or cabriolet body style ( for example , the CL and CLK models , though the C - Class is an exception , since it is also available as a sedan or station wagon ) .     `` D '' indicates the vehicle is equipped with a diesel engine .     `` E '' ( for `` Einspritzung '' ) indicates the vehicle 's engine is equipped with a petrol fuel injection . Also used for electric models and plug - in hybrids .     `` G '' was originally used for the Geländewagen off - road vehicle , but is now applied to Mercedes SUVs in general ( G , GLA , GLC , GLE and GLS ) .     `` K '' was used in the 1930s , indicating a supercharger ( `` Kompressor '' ) equipped engine . Two exceptions : the SSK and CLK , where K indicates `` Kurz '' ( short - wheelbase ) ( though the SSK had a supercharger ) .     `` L '' indicates `` Leicht '' ( lightweight ) for sporting models , and `` Lang '' ( long - wheelbase ) for sedan models .     `` R '' indicates `` Rennen '' ( racing ) , used for racing cars ( for example , the 300SLR ) .     `` S '' Sonderklasse `` Special class '' for flagship models , including the S - Class , and the SL - Class , SLR McLaren and SLS sports cars .     `` T '' indicates `` Touring '' and an estate ( or station wagon ) body style .       Some models in the 1950s also had lower - case letters ( b , c , and d ) to indicate specific trim levels . For other models , the numeric part of the designation does not match the engine displacement . This was done to show the model 's position in the model range independent of displacement or in the price matrix . For these vehicles , the actual displacement in liters is suffixed to the model designation . An exception was the 190 - class with the numeric designation of `` 190 '' as to denote its entry level in the model along with the displacement label on the right side of the boot ( 190E 2.3 for 2.3 - litre 4 - cylinder petrol motor , 190D 2.5 for 2.5 - litre 5 - cylinder diesel motor , and so forth ) . Some older models ( such as the SS and SSK ) did not have a number as part of the designation at all .     For the 1994 model year , Mercedes - Benz revised the naming system . Models were divided into `` classes '' denoted by an arrangement of up to three letters ( see `` Current model range '' above ) , followed by a three - digit ( or two - digit for AMG models , with the number approximately equal to the displacement in litres multiplied by 10 ) number related to the engine displacement as before . Variants of the same model such as an estate version or a vehicle with a diesel engine are no longer given a separate letter . The SLR and SLS supercars do not carry a numerical designation .     Today , many numerical designations no longer reflect the engine 's actual displacement , but more of the relative performance and marketing position . Despite its engine displacement in two litres , the powerplant in the A45 AMG produces 355 brake horsepower so the designation is higher as to indicate the greater performance . Another example is the E250 CGI having greater performance than the E200 CGI due to the different engine tuning even though both have 1.8 - litre engines . From the marketing perspective , E200 seems more `` upscale '' than E180 . Recent AMG models use the `` 63 '' designation ( in honor of the 1960s 6.3 - litre M100 engine ) despite being equipped with either a 6.2 - litre ( M156 ) , a 5.5 - litre ( M157 ) or even a 4.0 - litre engine .     Some models carry further designations indicating special features :       `` 4MATIC '' indicates the vehicle is equipped with all - wheel - drive .     `` BlueTEC '' indicates a diesel",

            "Overview ( edit )     The Natives Land Act of 1913 was the first major piece of segregation legislation passed by the Union Parliament . It was replaced by the current policy of land restitution . The act decreed that whites were not allowed to buy land from natives and vice versa . That stopped white farmers from buying more native land . Exceptions had to be approved by the Governor - General . The native areas left initially totaled less than 10 % of the entire land mass of the Union , which was later expanded to 13 % .     The Act further prohibited the practice of serfdom or sharecropping . It also protected existing agreements or arrangement of land hired or leased by both parties .     This land was in `` native reserve '' areas , which meant it was under `` communal '' tenure vested in African chiefs : it could not be bought , sold or used as surety . Outside such areas , perhaps of even greater significance for black farming was that the Act forbade black tenant farming on white - owned land . Since so many black farmers were sharecroppers or labor tenants , that had a devastating effect , but its full implementation was not immediate . The Act strengthened the chiefs , who were part of the state administration , but it forced many blacks into the `` white '' areas into wage labour ."

The film is about three United States servicemen readjusting to civilian life after coming home from World War II . Samuel Goldwyn was inspired to produce a film about veterans after reading an August 7 , 1944 , article in Time about the difficulties experienced by men returning to civilian life . Goldwyn hired former war correspondent MacKinlay Kantor to write a screenplay . His work was first published as a novella , Glory for Me , which Kantor wrote in blank verse . Robert E. Sherwood then adapted the novella as a screenplay .     The Best Years of Our Lives won seven Academy Awards in 1946 , including Best Picture , Best Director ( William Wyler ) , Best Actor ( Fredric March ) , Best Supporting Actor ( Harold Russell ) , Best Film Editing ( Daniel Mandell ) , Best Adapted Screenplay ( Robert E. Sherwood ) , and Best Original Score ( Hugo Friedhofer ) . In addition to its critical success , the film quickly became a great commercial success upon release . It became the highest - grossing film and most attended film in both the United States and UK since the release of Gone with the Wind , selling approximately 55 million tickets in the United States which equaled a gross of $23,650,000 . It remains the sixth most - attended film of all time in the UK , with over 20 million tickets sold . The film had one of the highest viewing figures of all time , with ticket sales exceeding $20.4 million .",
            "Production ( edit )     Director Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming Memphis Belle ( 1944 ) and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered . Wyler changed the original casting that had featured a veteran suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and sought out Harold Russell , a non-actor to take on the exacting role of Homer Parrish .     For The Best Years of Our Lives , he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes , in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling . Other Wyler touches included constructing life - size sets , which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions . The impact for the audience was immediate , as each scene played out in a realistic , natural way .     The Best Years of Our Lives began filming on April 15 , 1946 at a variety of locations , including the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden , Ontario International Airport , Ontario , California , Raleigh Studios , Hollywood , and the Samuel Goldwyn / Warner Hollywood Studios . The Best Years of Our Lives is notable for cinematographer Gregg Toland 's use of deep focus photography , in which objects both close to and distant from the camera are in sharp focus . For the passage of Fred Derry 's reliving a combat mission while sitting in the remains of a former bomber , Wyler used `` zoom '' effects to simulate Derry 's subjective state .     The `` Jackson High '' football stadium seen early in aerial footage of the bomber flying over the fictional Boone City , is Corcoran Stadium located at Xavier University in Cincinnati .

            "An Apology for poetry   Jump to : navigation , search Sidney   An Apology for Poetry ( or , The Defence of Poesy ) is a work of literary criticism by Elizabethan poet Philip Sidney . It was written in approximately 1579 , and first published in 1595 , after his death .     It is generally believed that he was at least partly motivated by Stephen Gosson , a former playwright who dedicated his attack on the English stage , The School of Abuse , to Sidney in 1579 , but Sidney primarily addresses more general objections to poetry , such as those of Plato . In his essay , Sidney integrates a number of classical and Italian precepts on fiction . The essence of his defense is that poetry , by combining the liveliness of history with the ethical focus of philosophy , is more effective than either history or philosophy in rousing its readers to virtue . The work also offers important comments on Edmund Spenser and the Elizabethan stage .",
