In this work, Sidney defends poetry against its critics, responding in part to Stephen Gosson's \"The School of Abuse,\" which criticized the English stage. Sidney presents his defense in the form of a judicial oration, likening it to a trial, and emphasizes the noble and courageous role of poetry, drawing a parallel between poets and soldiers. The overarching theme highlights the significance of poetry as an essential and valorous art form.",

In his essay , Sidney integrates a number of classical and Italian precepts on fiction . The essence of his defense is that poetry , by combining the liveliness of history with the ethical focus of philosophy , is more effective than either history or philosophy in rousing its readers to virtue .
