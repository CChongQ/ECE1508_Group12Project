            "Production ( edit )     The show has had an extended and sporadic run .  The first three series were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995 , followed by a series finale in the form of a two - part television film entitled The Last Shout in 1996 .  Creator Jennifer Saunders revived the show for a fourth series in 2001 , after having written and submitted a pilot entitled Mirrorball , which recruited nearly all of the original cast in new roles .  The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes .  However , Saunders felt the characters were far too rich and interesting to put aside , and were far better suited for her new story ideas .  Instead of Mirrorball , a new series of Absolutely Fabulous was proposed to the BBC , which later commissioned the fourth series in 2001 . ",
            "At the end of the episode `` Birthday '' , Edina and Patsy sang the song together using a karaoke machine .  More recently , it has been sung by Debbie Harry , who also guest - starred in the 2002 Christmas special `` Gay '' .  For series four , a line sung by David Bowie , `` Ziggy played guitar '' , from the song `` Ziggy Stardust '' played at the end of each episode .      Due to copyright issues , the theme song is missing from many of the US Region 1 DVDs , being replaced by an instrumental version of the song .  Also excised from the US DVD release is the musical number from Chicago performed by Horrocks , Gaffney , and Ryan , during a dream sequence in the series 5 episode `` Birthin ' '' .      In addition to the official theme song , in 1994 , Pet Shop Boys recorded a song for Comic Relief using excerpts of dialogue from the series put to dance music .  The single was attributed to `` Absolutely Fabulous produced by Pet Shop Boys '' . ",

Similar patterns of gene expression can be detected in the developing pharynx of amphioxus and hemichordates .  However , the vertebrate pharynx is unique in that it gives rise to endoskeletal support through the contribution of neural crest cells .      Pharyngeal jaws are a `` second set '' of jaws contained within the pharynx of many species of fish , distinct from the primary ( oral ) jaws .  Pharyngeal jaws have been studied in moray eels where their specific action is noted .  When the moray bites prey , it first bites normally with its oral jaws , capturing the prey . ",

However , the land - based cannons manned by the Confederates were capable of high - arcing ballistic trajectories and could therefore fire at parts of the fort that would have been out of naval guns ' reach .  Fort Sumter 's garrison could only safely fire the 21 working guns on the lowest level , which themselves , because of the limited elevation allowed by their embrasures , were largely incapable of delivering fire with trajectories high enough to seriously threaten Fort Moultrie .

A more immediate problem was the scarcity of cloth gunpowder cartridges or bags ; only 700 were available at the beginning of the battle and workmen sewed frantically to create more , in some cases using socks from Anderson 's personal wardrobe .

By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire .  The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine , where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored .  The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety , but two - thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed .  He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea , but the tide kept floating them back together into groups , some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds .  He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing , but the Confederates did the same , firing the hot shots almost exclusively .

Under orders from Beauregard , the guns fired in a counterclockwise sequence around the harbor , with 2 minutes between each shot ; Beauregard wanted to conserve ammunition , which he calculated would last for only 48 hours . Edmund Ruffin , another noted Virginia secessionist , had traveled to Charleston to be present for the beginning of the war , and fired one of the first shots at Sumter after the signal round , a 64 - pound shell from the Iron Battery at Cummings Point .

            "The climax was reached with the celebration of the flame of Reason in Notre Dame Cathedral on 10 November .      By November 1793 , the revolts in Normandy , Bordeaux and Lyon were overcome , in December also that in Toulon .  Two representatives on mission sent to punish Lyon between November 1793 and April 1794 executed 2,000 people to death by guillotine or firing - squad .  The Vendéan army since October roaming through Brittany on 12 December 1793 again ran up against Republican troops and saw 10,000 of its rebels perish , meaning the end of this once threatening army .      Some historians claim that after that Vendéan defeat Convention Republic armies in 1794 massacred 117,000 Vendéan civilians to obliterate the Vendéan people , but others contest that claim .

            "Many were so destitute that they could n't even feed their families and resorted to theft or prostitution to stay alive .  Meanwhile , the royal court at Versailles was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis .  While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch , in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition .  While he did reduce government expenditures , opponents in the parlements successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms .  The Enlightenment had produced many writers , pamphleteers and publishers who could inform or inflame public opinion .  The opposition used this resource to mobilise public opinion against the monarchy , which in turn tried to repress the underground literature .      Many other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals . ",
            "By August , political disagreement seemed enough to be summoned before the Tribunal ; appeal against a Tribunal verdict was impossible .  Late August 1793 , an army general had been guillotined on the accusation of choosing too timid strategies on the battlefield .  Mid-October , the widowed former queen Marie Antoinette was on trial for a long list of charges such as `` teaching ( her husband ) Louis Capet the art of dissimulation '' and incest with her son , she too was guillotined .  In October 1793 , 21 former ' Girondins ' Convention members who had n't left Paris after June were convicted to death and executed , on the charge of verbally supporting the preparation of an insurrection in Caen by fellow - Girondins .

Some historians consider the total civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of 170,000 or 450,000 lives .      Because of the extremely brutal forms that the Republican repression took in many places , historians such as Reynald Secher have called the event a `` genocide '' .  Historian François Furet concluded that the repression in the Vendee `` not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale but also a zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the region 's identity . ''    Profuse executions   The guillotine became the tool for a string of executions .  Louis XVI had already been guillotined before the start of the terror ; Queen Marie Antoinette , Barnave , Bailly , Brissot and other leading Girondins , Philippe Égalité ( despite his vote for the death of the King ) , Madame Roland and many others were executed by guillotine .

Despite succeeding in gaining independence for the Thirteen Colonies , France was severely indebted by the American Revolutionary War .  France 's inefficient and antiquated financial system could not finance this debt .  Faced with a financial crisis , the king called an Estates General , recommended by the Assembly of Notables in 1787 for the first time in over a century .      France was experiencing such a severe economic depression that there was n't enough food to go around .  As with most monarchies , the upper class was always insured a stable living so while the rich remained very wealthy , the majority of the French population was starving .  Many were so destitute that they could n't even feed their families and resorted to theft or prostitution to stay alive . "

The Revolution overthrew the monarchy , established a republic , experienced violent periods of political turmoil , and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond . Inspired by liberal and radical ideas , the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history , triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies . Through the Revolutionary Wars , it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East . Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history .",

            "Main - sequence stars employ two types of hydrogen fusion processes , and the rate of energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region .  Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts , based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process .  In the lower main sequence , energy is primarily generated as the result of the proton - proton chain , which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium .  Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle .  ( See the chart . )  This process uses atoms of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium .      At a stellar core temperature of 18 million Kelvin , the PP process and CNO cycle are equally efficient , and each type generates half of the star 's net luminosity . ",
            "The energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process , and the luminosity of the star increases .  This results in a much shorter length of time in this stage compared to the main sequence lifetime .  ( For example , the Sun is predicted to spend 130 million years burning helium , compared to about 12 billion years burning hydrogen . )  Thus , about 90 % of the observed stars above 0.5 M will be on the main sequence .  On average , main - sequence stars are known to follow an empirical mass - luminosity relationship .  The luminosity ( L ) of the star is roughly proportional to the total mass ( M ) as the following power law :       L ∝ M 3.5 ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ begin ( smallmatrix ) L \\ \\ propto \\ M ^ ( 3.5 ) \\ end ( smallmatrix ) ) )       This relationship applies to main - sequence stars in the range 0.1 -- 50 M .      The amount of fuel available for nuclear fusion is proportional to the mass of the star . ",
            "Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand , lowering the pressure at the core .  Thus the star forms a self - regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime .      Main - sequence stars employ two types of hydrogen fusion processes , and the rate of energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region .  Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts , based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process .

            "The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support the remainder of the star .  A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core , resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure .  Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand , lowering the pressure at the core .  Thus the star forms a self - regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime .      Main - sequence stars employ two types of hydrogen fusion processes , and the rate of energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region .  Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts , based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process .  In the lower main sequence , energy is primarily generated as the result of the proton - proton chain , which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium . "

        "response": "Energy in a main sequence star is generated through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium in the star's dense core. This process releases thermal energy, which is then transported to the surface and radiated away. The star remains in hydrostatic equilibrium, with the outward thermal pressure from the core balanced by the inward gravitational pressure from the outer layers.",

            "long_answer": "After condensation of mass and ignition of a star , it generates thermal energy in the dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium . During this stage of the star 's lifetime , it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass , but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors . All main - sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium , where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers . The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance . Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere . The energy is carried by either radiation or convection , with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients , higher opacity or both .",

On the other hand , titles such as archbishop or patriarch imply no ontological alteration , and existing bishops who rise to those offices do not require further ordination .

Sidney argues that poetry is superior to history and philosophy in inspiring virtue, as it combines the vividness of history with the moral focus of philosophy. He incorporates classical and Italian ideas on fiction and comments on figures like Edmund Spenser and the Elizabethan stage.
