Against the orders of Vince , who now leads The Right Arm resistance , the three leave their camp to rescue their immune friend Minho , who is being tortured by the organization WCKD in hopes of developing a cure for the virus . Heading for the `` Last City '' , where WCKD 's headquarters is located , the group is attacked by Cranks , humans infected with the Flare . However , they are saved by Jorge and Brenda , who join them . </P> <P> The group makes it to the wall of the Last City , which protects the city from Cranks . Outside the wall , people are rallying in protest to be let into the city . When WCKD opens fire at the protesters , the group is captured by a contingent of masked men and are taken to a hideout . One of the masked men is revealed to be Gally , who has survived being killed by Minho at the end of The Maze Runner . Gally takes them to see Lawrence , a rebellion leader for those outside the walls , who grants them permission to enter the Last City through a secret entrance . Gally leads Thomas and Newt through to the city and , spotting Teresa , Gally tells Thomas that she can get them into WCKD headquarters . The three capture her and she agrees to help them . </P> <P> Thomas , Newt , and Gally escort Teresa inside WCKD headquarters and toward the location of the Immunes . Gally looks after the Immune children and stays to find a serum that can treat the Flare , while Thomas , Newt , and Teresa go to find Minho . They are caught and chased by a vengeful Janson , who leads WCKD 's troops . Teresa lets them escape to find Minho , before rushing to do a blood test on Thomas ' blood , which she obtained when removing trackers from the Gladers . </P> <P> Gally gets the serum and takes the Immune children outside to a bus where Brenda is waiting . While Gally makes his way back into WCKD headquarters to find Thomas , Brenda is forced to leave with the Immune children in a bus as WCKD forces close in on them . Thomas and Newt reunite with Minho in the medical wing . They are chased by Janson before escaping . Teresa discovers that Thomas ' blood can cure the Flare . She shares her discovery with WCKD 's leader Ava Paige , both agreeing that they must find Thomas . Brenda and the Immune children are cornered by WCKD authorities but are saved by Frypan . Meanwhile , Lawrence rallies his rebels outside the city before blowing a hole in the city wall , allowing his allies and the infected people to storm the city . Outside the headquarters , Gally finds Thomas , Minho , and Newt . Sending Minho and Gally ahead , Newt gives Thomas a necklace with a silver cylinder pendant before passing out . Teresa transmits her voice throughout the city , telling Thomas that his blood can save Newt if he will only return to WCKD . Newt , nearly completely subsumed by the Flare , regains consciousness and attacks Thomas , while begging Thomas to kill him . Left with no other option , Thomas kills Newt . </P> <P> Thomas makes his way back to WCKD and confronts Ava , who stresses that WCKD 's intentions are good . However , she is killed by Janson , who is turning into a Crank . Janson knocks Thomas out and drags him to a lab where Teresa is ready to extract his blood . However , he reveals that he and WCKD are only truly interested in curing those whom they please , which results in Teresa turning on him . After a fight , Janson is killed , allowing Thomas and Teresa to escape to the rooftop where an aircraft piloted by Jorge and Vince is waiting . Thomas makes it aboard , but Teresa is killed when the headquarters comes apart after being hit by a building collapsing owing to the rebels ' attacks . </P> <P> The group reunites with the rest of the Immunes and The Right Arm , escaping to a safe haven that was revealed by Ava , where the remaining population can live in safety . There , Thomas discovers that the pendant Newt gave to him had a note in it . Still traumatized by Teresa 's death , he reads the note , in which Newt tells him to look after himself and everyone , before thanking Thomas for being his friend . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Dylan O'Brien as Thomas </Li> <Li> Kaya Scodelario as Teresa </Li> <Li> Thomas Brodie - Sangster as Newt </Li> <Li> Dexter Darden as Frypan </Li> <Li> Nathalie Emmanuel as Harriet </Li> <Li> Giancarlo Esposito as Jorge </Li> <Li> Aidan Gillen as Janson </Li> <Li> Walton Goggins as Lawrence </Li> <Li> Ki Hong Lee as Minho </Li> <Li> Jacob Lofland as Aris </Li> <Li> Katherine McNamara as Sonya </Li> <Li> Barry Pepper as Vince </Li> <Li> Will Poulter as Gally </Li> <Li> Rosa Salazar as Brenda </Li> <Li> Patricia Clarkson as Ava Paige </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> In March 2015 , it was confirmed that T.S.

Against the orders of Vince , who now leads The Right Arm resistance , the three leave their camp to rescue their immune friend Minho , who is being tortured by the organization WCKD in hopes of developing a cure for the virus . Heading for the `` Last City '' , where WCKD 's headquarters is located , the group is attacked by Cranks , humans infected with the Flare . However , they are saved by Jorge and Brenda , who join them . </P> <P> The group makes it to the wall of the Last City , which protects the city from Cranks . Outside the wall , people are rallying in protest to be let into the city . When WCKD opens fire at the protesters , the group is captured by a contingent of masked men and are taken to a hideout . One of the masked men is revealed to be Gally , who has survived being killed by Minho at the end of The Maze Runner . Gally takes them to see Lawrence , a rebellion leader for those outside the walls , who grants them permission to enter the Last City through a secret entrance . Gally leads Thomas and Newt through to the city and , spotting Teresa , Gally tells Thomas that she can get them into WCKD headquarters . The three capture her and she agrees to help them . </P> <P> Thomas , Newt , and Gally escort Teresa inside WCKD headquarters and toward the location of the Immunes . Gally looks after the Immune children and stays to find a serum that can treat the Flare , while Thomas , Newt , and Teresa go to find Minho . They are caught and chased by a vengeful Janson , who leads WCKD 's troops . Teresa lets them escape to find Minho , before rushing to do a blood test on Thomas ' blood , which she obtained when removing trackers from the Gladers . </P> <P> Gally gets the serum and takes the Immune children outside to a bus where Brenda is waiting . While Gally makes his way back into WCKD headquarters to find Thomas , Brenda is forced to leave with the Immune children in a bus as WCKD forces close in on them . Thomas and Newt reunite with Minho in the medical wing . They are chased by Janson before escaping . Teresa discovers that Thomas ' blood can cure the Flare . She shares her discovery with WCKD 's leader Ava Paige , both agreeing that they must find Thomas . Brenda and the Immune children are cornered by WCKD authorities but are saved by Frypan . Meanwhile , Lawrence rallies his rebels outside the city before blowing a hole in the city wall , allowing his allies and the infected people to storm the city . Outside the headquarters , Gally finds Thomas , Minho , and Newt . Sending Minho and Gally ahead , Newt gives Thomas a necklace with a silver cylinder pendant before passing out . Teresa transmits her voice throughout the city , telling Thomas that his blood can save Newt if he will only return to WCKD . Newt , nearly completely subsumed by the Flare , regains consciousness and attacks Thomas , while begging Thomas to kill him . Left with no other option , Thomas kills Newt . </P> <P> Thomas makes his way back to WCKD and confronts Ava , who stresses that WCKD 's intentions are good . However , she is killed by Janson , who is turning into a Crank . Janson knocks Thomas out and drags him to a lab where Teresa is ready to extract his blood . However , he reveals that he and WCKD are only truly interested in curing those whom they please , which results in Teresa turning on him . After a fight , Janson is killed , allowing Thomas and Teresa to escape to the rooftop where an aircraft piloted by Jorge and Vince is waiting . Thomas makes it aboard , but Teresa is killed when the headquarters comes apart after being hit by a building collapsing owing to the rebels ' attacks . </P> <P> The group reunites with the rest of the Immunes and The Right Arm , escaping to a safe haven that was revealed by Ava , where the remaining population can live in safety . There , Thomas discovers that the pendant Newt gave to him had a note in it . Still traumatized by Teresa 's death , he reads the note , in which Newt tells him to look after himself and everyone , before thanking Thomas for being his friend . </P>\n","--- Section 3 ---\n","<H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Dylan O'Brien as Thomas </Li> <Li> Kaya Scodelario as Teresa </Li> <Li> Thomas Brodie - Sangster as Newt </Li> <Li> Dexter Darden as Frypan </Li> <Li> Nathalie Emmanuel as Harriet </Li> <Li> Giancarlo Esposito as Jorge </Li> <Li> Aidan Gillen as Janson </Li> <Li> Walton Goggins as Lawrence </Li> <Li> Ki Hong Lee as Minho </Li> <Li> Jacob Lofland as Aris </Li> <Li> Katherine McNamara as Sonya </Li> <Li> Barry Pepper as Vince </Li> <Li> Will Poulter as Gally </Li> <Li> Rosa Salazar as Brenda </Li> <Li> Patricia Clarkson as Ava Paige </Li> </Ul>\n","--- Section 4 ---\n","<H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> In March 2015 , it was confirmed that T.S.
